<p>Peace is something that is really hard to come by. Many of us lay awake in bed racked with worry. We feel the anxiety rise in us and the frustrations of the day or week or month overflow in our heart and mind. Our lives are anything but peaceful.</p><p>If you have been in a bookstore recently you will see that the self-help section is probably the largest (this is especially true in Christian bookstores). There are books on relational peace, financial peace, emotional peace, and any other kind of “peace” that your heart desires. Often when you dive in and read them the narrative is the same, “work harder.”</p><p>All these different avenues of peace are really masks for what we most desperately want. At the heart of our desire for peace is peace with God. We are all made in his image. That image has been radically corrupted by sin. Yet, the image remains. They cry of our heart is to do whatever we can to make peace with him.</p><p>How do we respond? We work harder. We try to be good. Day after day we try to do what’s right. The morning comes, we rise from our bed, and declare, “Today I will do better.”</p><p>Then we fail. Our fuse is short. The thoughts running around inside us are angry and frustration filled. We worry and stress evermore about things. We desire and demand peace yet experience great frustration.</p><p>Where can we find peace? How can we experience this great desire of our heart? If working harder and trying more doesn’t give us peace what does?</p><p>Saint Paul writes this in his magisterial letter to the Romans,</p><blockquote>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.<br>(Romans 5:1-5 ESV)</blockquote><p>Where do we find peace? It is experienced through faith in Jesus. Why?<a href="https://medium.com/the-mission-journal/bread-wine-righteousness-and-grace-1cb63f81f19a#.hgxhep65l" data-href="https://medium.com/the-mission-journal/bread-wine-righteousness-and-grace-1cb63f81f19a#.hgxhep65l">Because by having faith in Jesus we are justified by God</a>. This faith, Paul says, grants us access to grace which gives hope. So that, even when we experience suffering we are able to rejoice. Why? Because through faith by grace the Holy Spirit pours out God’s love into us. Therefore, this hope that we have “does not put us to shame.”</p><p>Over the last few months I have watched a dear friend suffer. He is battling cancer and everyday is a new day of pain and frustration. Days spent at hospital. Nights spent sweating and without sleep. A wound that is slow to heal. Pumping his body full of poison to kill the cancer. Yet, in the midst of this he has peace. He rejoices in his suffering because of faith by grace. He has a hope that comes from faith.</p><p>Do you want peace? Real peace? If so, stop trying so hard. You can’t work up peace. It doesn’t come about by trying to be good. Your good works will not bring you the peace you desire. No, peace comes by faith which grants you access to grace.</p><p>God has made a way for us to have peace with him. It is through faith in Jesus.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">The Journal</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
