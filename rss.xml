My wife, Amy, and I both grew up appreciating salesmanship. The other day I had breakfast with my Dad and he told me about his new television. He was not planning on buying a television, he just wanted to go in and buy a rack that was capable of holding his 40” TV and a 65” TV whenever he upgraded.</p>,<p>The salesman went to work.</p>,<p>Dad appreciated the salesmanship (and the price!) so he bought at new 65” TV.</p>]]></description>

I write them and then often wonder if their even read. Potential employers want them to see if this person can follow through on a mundane task or to see if a person will vouch for them.</p>,<p>In the “real” world, there doesn’t seem to be much need for letters of recommendation. Your work speaks for itself. Results matter. Your production in your field is your letter of recommendation.</p>]]></description>

They get frustrated because I don’t really want to discuss things like evolution and existence of God. I’m not all that interested in those questions. I think those questions tend to work themselves out on their own in the mind and heart of a person.&nbsp;</p>,<p>What I’m really interested in talking about is not so much a&nbsp;“what” but a&nbsp;“who.” I am fascinated by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Why? Because the entire faith of Christianity rises and falls on this one man. Quite simply, if he didn’t do what the New Testament writers said he did then Christianity is a complete sham and a waste of time.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

It often feels like they believe the world revolves around them. Don’t get me wrong, they are generous and kind. They care for people and I think they’re good friends. But, they are still teenagers and so at times, they believe the world revolves around them.&nbsp;</p>,<p>I remember when the full reality of my parents divorce hit me. They were divorced when I was nine but it wasn’t until later that it really sunk in. I was probably 12 or 13 and I remember thinking,&nbsp;“Why me?”&nbsp;</p>,<p>That seems to be the question we wrestle with when bad things happen to us.&nbsp;</p>,<p><em><strong>“Why me?”</strong></em></p>]]></description>

There are so many really good things for followers of Jesus to do in their lives.&nbsp;</p>,<p>How can anyone possibly figure out what God wants them to do? How are we supposed to live our lives? With the infinite possibilities before us, is there any direction?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

This is the regional gathering for the Teaching and Ruling Elders from our region. It’s a remarkable time to gather with men and women who have said,&nbsp;“I’m all in. I’m willing to serve the church as an under-shepherd of the Great Shepherd.&nbsp;</p>,<p>These men and women have experienced an inward and outward call to serve the church. They have studied and prepared to lead through service.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Seriously, how does that work?&nbsp;</p>,<p>There were so many questions and I had to have answers.&nbsp;</p>,<p>I read everything I could. The Internet was just becoming a&nbsp;“thing.” The Church was finally catching up with modernity and there were tons of books on apologetics that I was able to read too. The evidence was out there.&nbsp;</p>,<p>Yet, my questions were unending. My doubt was real. My faith was real. How could they both exist?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Someone hurts you and it just festers there under the surface. You’re never able to really let it go. You just hold on to that slight and as a result you lose trust. When trust is lost, dislike, contempt, and hatred comes.&nbsp;</p>,<p>Why? Because we haven’t forgiven them.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>
