Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the “why” and the impact of these statements in our lives.</p>,<p>The culture of the Bible was one of great diversity. Pluralism was the norm. In many ways biblical culture reflects our own. There were beliefs in many different gods and there were as many religions as there were clans. The book of Genesis starts with the words, “In the beginning God created…” When Moses penned these words he was doing so to begin to identify and differentiate <em>the </em>God from the gods.</p>]]></description>

I was reminded again that our culture doesn’t value the lives of women and children. </p>]]></description>

We did men’s retreats every year. There was a very specific model that we thought these men had to fit in; tough, rugged, and macho.</p>,<p>We also spent a lot of time trying to teach college girls to be women. This focused a lot on their outward appearance teaching them to dress modestly so they didn’t cause the “men” to “stumble.”</p>]]></description>
