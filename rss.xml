I was sitting in the office of my pastor and friend, Bob. We were discussing life and following Jesus. We were talking about the Holy Spirit. He was asking me about yielding to the Spirit and trusting him to empower me. I was not totally on board with this idea. As I shared with him that day, the thought scared me, to my core.</p>]]></description>

It takes place in Acts 9.

You know, one of those moments where you feel the flesh waking up. Your face heats up, your pulse quickens, your fists clench, and you know what is about to happen. You know you’re about say something you will later regret. Your mind is screaming, “NO! Stop! Run!” Your flesh is screaming out, “I will destroy. Right here, right now, I will destroy.”</p>]]></description>

Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the “why” and the impact of these statements in our lives.</p>,<p>I think the argument can be made that no person in the history of the world has had as much of an impact as Jesus of Nazareth. We mark time before and after him (yes, I know that CE/BCE are the now the primary means of marking time, but they are the same as BC and AD). It is safe to say that no other person has had as much written about him or has been studied so thoroughly. His birth, life, and death have been studied, debated, and marveled at. Jesus is a name that brings a reaction in those who hear the name and in those who say the name. Regardless of your worldview, everyone must admit that this Jesus of Nazareth, was at the very least a remarkable individual. </p>]]></description>

I can’t count the number of friends who have burned out in ministry. They reach a place of complete exhaustion, desperation, hopelessness, cynicism, or depression that drives them to walk away from their calling. It’s usually some combination of these things and more. </p>,<p>There seems to be one particular trait that is cuts across all these people in their burn out. They were afraid to rest and refused to rest so they could control everything. </p>]]></description>

Pluralism was the norm. In many ways biblical culture reflects our own. There were beliefs in many different gods and there were as many religions as there were clans. The book of Genesis starts with the words, “In the beginning God created…” When Moses penned these words he was doing so to begin to identify and differentiate <em>the </em>God from the gods.</p>]]></description>
