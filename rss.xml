They are a coveted voting block. According to many pundits it was their ability to get out and vote that won Donald Trump the presidency over Hillary Clinton (though the real culprit was probably lack of voter turn out for Clinton). This political engagement has been seen as a key component to the “Culture War.” This war, according to some, is over no less than the soul of America.</p>]]></description>

It is the cornerstone and bedrock of our faith. Without the resurrection there would be no Christianity. Yet, what’s fascinating is that Jesus was all about something else, the ascension. </p>]]></description>

It is an amazing tale that gets richer as the books progress. Too many times "sequels" are not as good as the original. I think what makes&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;particularly good is that it was conceived as a whole from the beginning. Many of our current novel series were not. The first one is written and published and then after it has shown to be marketable the rest of the books are commissioned. Often this leads to holes in the plot or some disjointedness in the narrative. Not so with&nbsp;<em>The Lord of The Rings.&nbsp;</em>It goes somewhere from the start. The beginning of the story really only takes its full meaning from the end of the story.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

It is when we Christians traditionally believe that Jesus celebrated this final Passover meal with his disciples and then was arrested. It is a somber evening. It is the beginning of the end of the life of Jesus. In mere hours he will be handed over, beaten, and ultimately crucified.&nbsp;</p>,<p>Yet, in the midst of this Jesus is looking at the bigger picture. He is shaping and creating identity for his disciples. He showing them that there is more to come after his crucifixion. The Cross is not he end, it is the beginning.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Perhaps your mind wanders to what others think of you. Maybe you are filled with thoughts of your favorite sports team or what you're going to to do this weekend. Are your thoughts filled with the news and everything that is happening in the world?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

These folks could plant a water lily in a desert and have it grow. I am not one of these people. It simply wasn't part of my life growing up. I never learned the "joy of gardening." Yard work was always a chore. Our "gardens" simply meant more work.&nbsp;</p>,<p>When we built our home we had some landscaping done, professionally. We did this because we knew we wouldn't do it on our own. As we met with the landscaper we told him we want as little maintenance as possible. He came through in a big way! We have, what I consider to be beautiful landscaping and it doesn't require much from me.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>
