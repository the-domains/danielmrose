            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Peace Through Faith</h1><p>If you have been in a bookstore recently you will see that the self-help section is probably the largest (this is especially true in Christian bookstores). There are books on relational peace, financial peace, emotional peace, and any other kind of “peace” that your heart desires. Often when you dive in and read them the narrative is the same, “work harder.”</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ec879860-22e2-430a-947d-10101a544e3b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bread, Wine, Righteousness, and Grace</h1><p>We’re all standing in our kitchen around our island. On the island is some homemade bread and some wine. We are stepping into that moment of time where we connect with the divine. After I break the bread and bless the wine I remind my friends to not eat or drink in a manner that’s unworthy. That is, we are to make sure that there is nothing between God and us or other people and us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7dcd634bf4467a83b4aa83af50878bd280b3b9bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
