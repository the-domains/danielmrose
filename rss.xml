If you've ever been around a vegan, the same principle applies.&nbsp;The cross-fitter may be the best example of this! While these are all generalizations and are used as punch lines to jokes, there is some real truth to them. Why? Because these people have experienced significant life change through their experiences and these things have, in a sense, placed a song in their heart.</p>]]></description>

He's a pastor's pastor. This man translated the Message while he was pastoring a local church. He has written extensively on what it means to be a pastor and what it means to be the church. One of my favorite quotes of his is this,</p>,<blockquote>The vocation of pastor has been replaced by the strategies of religious entrepreneurs with business plans.</blockquote>,<p>The church has, by and large, lost its way. It has become a place of commerce. Many of our church buildings look like malls. We work hard to figure out how to provide services for our consumers, I mean, congregants. The sad reality is that we are no different from those who have come before us. The Reformation came about, in part, because the Church was selling indulgences to help people get into heaven. But, even before that, the people of God mixed up their worship with commerce.</p>]]></description>

That's something that a lot of athletes say. Have you noticed that? Many of our greatest athletes come from unbelievably difficult circumstances. After they hit it big, many give back to where they came from. They don't want to forget their story and where they came from.</p>,<p>My story is like many others. I grew up in a single mother home. Mom worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. There were a number of years after my parents divorce where finances were in short supply. My Dad took care of big things for us, so we never missed out on school trips or playing sports. The day to day was different though. We just didn't have a lot. When I was in high school and college I felt ashamed of my story. I just wanted to forget it. I didn't want people to really know about it. But, as I have matured I have discovered that my story is a gift. It is a gift because through it God has shown me what redemption looks like. Through it I am able to meet so many more people where they are at in their lives.</p>]]></description>

During a sales meeting Marty, the sales manager said, “Remember, when you’re talking with a customer about some amazing deal from another dealer that if it’s too good to be true, it probably is.” Over and over again we find that to be a truism don’t we? People rarely under promise and over deliver. The fact is, if it’s too good to be true, it probably is. </p>,<p>Then there’s Jesus. </p>]]></description>

I was sixteen and had had my driver's license for a few weeks. It was one of those fall days in Michigan where the leaves had fallen and there was a thick dew. My family lived in a small neighborhood shaped like a horseshoe. On my way to school I was changing CDs and not paying attention. I looked up to see I was running out of road. I slammed on the brakes and turned the car. I had hit the wet leaves and slid into a few mailboxes. Looking around, I saw no one, so I backed out and hurried off to school.</p>,<p>After school, I was watching television and the phone rang. My stomach dropped. Somehow, I knew this was about the mailboxes. I heard the "Yes" and "OK" and "We will see you soon, officer." I was dead. Mom looked at me and asked if I had been a part of a "hit and run." I was caught and all I could do was say yes and tell her the story.</p>,<p>We went to the police station where I got a scolding and then I had to apologize to the neighbors. It was horrible.</p>]]></description>
