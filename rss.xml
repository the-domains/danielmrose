            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>May All Who Seek</h1><p>Tuesday nights I host a gathering of friends at the local pub.

            <title><![CDATA[Thankfulness Our Sacrifice]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Thankfulness Our Sacrifice</h1><p>There are many folks who feel like there are two different Gods in the Bible. They often say, “There’s the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament.” This feeling comes out because they feel like the God of the Old Testament is angry and the God of the New Testament is loving. As I’m reading through the stories of the Judges of Israel, I totally get that. Yet, over the years I have found that this is simply not the case.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Our Fickle Faith]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Our Fickle Faith</h1><p>On Sundays our Missional Communities are looking at the whole story of the Bible. This past Sunday we talked about Moses. This coming Sunday we are looking at the story of the people wandering in the desert. As I started preparing and working through a number of the passages in Exodus and Numbers I was struck by two things: (1) All God asked for was faith and (2) the fickle faith of the people.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/072baf94-6071-4c68-b539-5205a3716a45.jpg"></article>]]></description>
