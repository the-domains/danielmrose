            <title><![CDATA[Our Fickle Faith]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Our Fickle Faith</h1><p>On Sundays our Missional Communities are looking at the whole story of the Bible. This past Sunday we talked about Moses. This coming Sunday we are looking at the story of the people wandering in the desert. As I started preparing and working through a number of the passages in Exodus and Numbers I was struck by two things: (1) All God asked for was faith and (2) the fickle faith of the people.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/072baf94-6071-4c68-b539-5205a3716a45.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bread, Wine, Righteousness, and Grace</h1><p>We’re all standing in our kitchen around our island. On the island is some homemade bread and some wine. We are stepping into that moment of time where we connect with the divine. After I break the bread and bless the wine I remind my friends to not eat or drink in a manner that’s unworthy. That is, we are to make sure that there is nothing between God and us or other people and us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7dcd634bf4467a83b4aa83af50878bd280b3b9bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
