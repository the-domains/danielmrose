Integrity is a concept that people talk much about but don’t really live out. I’m often surprised by the lack of integrity most people have.</p>]]></description>

Sometimes works of fiction do that to me (A Brave New World rocked my world). Sometimes it’s reading history. Other times it is talking with a new friend. In this particular moment, it was a television show.</p>]]></description>

I’m not even close to being an expert. I have a son whose 15 and a daughter who is 13. Both of them are excelling as students. They each have passions that they are pursuing with zeal. I think both of them are becoming good people. They have friends, they respect adults, they are both people that my wife and I enjoy being around. </p>]]></description>

We did men’s retreats every year. There was a very specific model that we thought these men had to fit in; tough, rugged, and macho.</p>,<p>We also spent a lot of time trying to teach college girls to be women. This focused a lot on their outward appearance teaching them to dress modestly so they didn’t cause the “men” to “stumble.”</p>]]></description>

The Americans were designed to be the heroes and the other parts of the world world were displayed as being less than in Christian faith. </p>,<p><strong>That is illustrative of our individual hearts too, I think.

The story of the early church is fascinating to me. The boldness of the apostles blows me away. They are constantly standing in the midst of the people proclaiming Jesus. Paul traveled the known world and stood before kings preaching Jesus. It’s a beautiful story of grace and adventure. </p>]]></description>

They are a coveted voting block. According to many pundits it was their ability to get out and vote that won Donald Trump the presidency over Hillary Clinton (though the real culprit was probably lack of voter turn out for Clinton). This political engagement has been seen as a key component to the “Culture War.” This war, according to some, is over no less than the soul of America.</p>]]></description>

It is the cornerstone and bedrock of our faith. Without the resurrection there would be no Christianity. Yet, what’s fascinating is that Jesus was all about something else, the ascension. </p>]]></description>
