These folks could plant a water lily in a desert and have it grow. I am not one of these people. It simply wasn't part of my life growing up. I never learned the "joy of gardening." Yard work was always a chore. Our "gardens" simply meant more work.&nbsp;</p>,<p>When we built our home we had some landscaping done, professionally. We did this because we knew we wouldn't do it on our own. As we met with the landscaper we told him we want as little maintenance as possible. He came through in a big way! We have, what I consider to be beautiful landscaping and it doesn't require much from me.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

I think the hardest thing that I have had to do over years is help people see that they are in destructive relationships. Each of us has a desire to be deeply loved and accepted. For many people they are willing to be in a destructive relationship simply to be in a relationship.</p>]]></description>

It is the kind of fear that strikes people to the heart. This fear is real and palpable. You might think it is the fear that comes from wondering if your child will grow up well, but it's not. Maybe this fear is that you won't like their future spouse, that's not it either.</p>]]></description>

It is an amazing tale that gets richer as the books progress. Too many times "sequels" are not as good as the original. I think what makes&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;particularly good is that it was conceived as a whole from the beginning. Many of our current novel series were not. The first one is written and published and then after it has shown to be marketable the rest of the books are commissioned. Often this leads to holes in the plot or some disjointedness in the narrative. Not so with&nbsp;<em>The Lord of The Rings.&nbsp;</em>It goes somewhere from the start. The beginning of the story really only takes its full meaning from the end of the story.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Have you heard them embrace them as mantras and repeat them? Maybe you've said them too. I often wonder what people mean when they say these kinds of things. There is some sort of longing in people's hearts for our country to regain some kind of prominence that they once believed it had. Others desire to see what they consider to be a return to morality and civility.</p>]]></description>

One of the simple pleasures I get out of being a dad is hearing, "Dad, you're so embarrassing." Yup. That's right! Typically this little phrase flies out when I am not allowing them to do something they want to do. Particularly when this happens in front of their friends. It also happens when I try to be hip and cool (this failed for me even before kids, but now it's just fun to watch them shudder). Even though I embarrass them at times, they still love me fiercely.</p>]]></description>

It was so hard. I cried. He cried. It was awful. Awful. When I say the first time, I mean the first time he could really understand that he was in trouble and that Dad was mad because of his actions. I think he was five or six. He was being ungrateful and so we took away his gaming system. He was able to grasp that this was something different.</p>]]></description>
