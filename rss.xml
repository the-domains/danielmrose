            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Peace Through Faith</h1><p>If you have been in a bookstore recently you will see that the self-help section is probably the largest (this is especially true in Christian bookstores).

We are stepping into that moment of time where we connect with the divine. After I break the bread and bless the wine I remind my friends to not eat or drink in a manner that’s unworthy. That is, we are to make sure that there is nothing between God and us or other people and us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7dcd634bf4467a83b4aa83af50878bd280b3b9bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
