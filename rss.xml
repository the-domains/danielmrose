Often times we, Christians, try to lower the standard by saying things like, "We're still sinful. We aren't perfect and we won't be perfect." While that's true, the reality is that we as followers of Jesus ought be different. Our lives should look different from people who do not follow Jesus. The kicker is that the world knows this. They know this because we have loudly told them how they ought to live. As a result, they expect us to live up to our standards.</p>,<p>Weird, right?</p>,<p>Or maybe not so much.</p>]]></description>

There are news interviews with “experts” about Jesus. The question on many people's minds is, "Who was Jesus?" Jesus captures the imaginations of our world. He was so unique that 2,000 years later he still draws us in.</p>,<p>Who was he? More to the point, who is he?</p>]]></description>

Some of us think about four point outlines or The Romans Road. Others think about service. Still others, think about the crucifixion and resurrection. Some people may think about Jesus being victorious over sin and death. You might think about how to get to heaven or how to avoid hell. Maybe you think about music.&nbsp;</p>,<p>Do you think about power?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

If you've ever been around a vegan, the same principle applies.&nbsp;The cross-fitter may be the best example of this! While these are all generalizations and are used as punch lines to jokes, there is some real truth to them. Why? Because these people have experienced significant life change through their experiences and these things have, in a sense, placed a song in their heart.</p>]]></description>
