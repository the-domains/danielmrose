            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Love and Hate</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b3cc1e4e-3e71-4214-afa4-85bab5297308.jpg">,<p>When you love someone you begin to love what they love and dislike what they dislike. It's a strange thing as you begin to see this happen within yourself. On the other hand, it's really fun when you see it happening in your spouse. What's interesting is that this is true within our relationship with God too. As we grow to love him we will begin to love more of what he loves and hate what he hates.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Don’t Throw Rocks</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bef05bc3-1171-42eb-a802-4e115c817537.jpg">,<p>The sign read, "Do not throw rocks into the water." So what do we do? We pick up a rock and throw it into the water. If there was a severe punishment attached to it, we might look around first and then throw a rock in the water. Why do we do that? Is the rule a bad rule? Did the rule make us do this or is there something within us that demands to break the rule?</p>]]></description>

Many days I think, "If I were in charge I could get this place squared away pretty quick." It is easy to judge because our judgement is typically not impacted by context or nuance. I think this is why the Scriptures often remind us who will ultimately judge the nations.</p>]]></description>

We all go through times where it seems like the world is against us. Relationships get hard. Work conversations don't go as planned. There is strife in our marriage or with our children. Sometimes it just feels like everyone is out to get us. When you're in the midst of those kinds of times, who do you blame?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Often times we, Christians, try to lower the standard by saying things like, "We're still sinful. We aren't perfect and we won't be perfect." While that's true, the reality is that we as followers of Jesus ought be different. Our lives should look different from people who do not follow Jesus. The kicker is that the world knows this. They know this because we have loudly told them how they ought to live. As a result, they expect us to live up to our standards.</p>,<p>Weird, right?</p>,<p>Or maybe not so much.</p>]]></description>

There are news interviews with “experts” about Jesus. The question on many people's minds is, "Who was Jesus?" Jesus captures the imaginations of our world. He was so unique that 2,000 years later he still draws us in.</p>,<p>Who was he? More to the point, who is he?</p>]]></description>

Some of us think about four point outlines or The Romans Road. Others think about service. Still others, think about the crucifixion and resurrection. Some people may think about Jesus being victorious over sin and death. You might think about how to get to heaven or how to avoid hell. Maybe you think about music.&nbsp;</p>,<p>Do you think about power?&nbsp;</p>]]></description>
