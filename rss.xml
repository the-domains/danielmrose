I was reminded because our systems that are designed to protect the most vulnerable fail. I was reminded because once again violence, which we glorify, metastasized in real life causing real pain and real suffering. I was reminded again that our culture doesn’t value the lives of women and children. </p>]]></description>

We did men’s retreats every year. There was a very specific model that we thought these men had to fit in; tough, rugged, and macho.</p>,<p>We also spent a lot of time trying to teach college girls to be women. This focused a lot on their outward appearance teaching them to dress modestly so they didn’t cause the “men” to “stumble.”</p>]]></description>
