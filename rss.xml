Will You?</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9c7f617-8e95-4eeb-85a9-482d75e0c9e4.jpg" alt="Photo by JJ Thompson on Unsplash">,<p>Do you like to learn? I pretend to like to learn. Learning requires me to change. It demands that I do something different from what I used to do. Learning requires me to change my mind, actions, and possibly even beliefs. So, I pretend to like learning. I listen intently and nod my head at appropriate times. </p>,<p>Every once in a while go next level with a well-timed, “Hmmm…” </p>]]></description>

We are a community of people who are being put back together. This means that we haven’t arrived and probably won’t arrive any time soon. Being a people under construction means that there will inevitably be failures and hurts and sin. To be a Christian means that we must be connected to the local congregation, for there is no other place to be a Christian (I’m paraphrasing Eugene Peterson here). </p>]]></description>

We have little to no time to simply be with people. There is no opportunity to listen, pray, or to just look around. Every day we rush to the next place, to the next appointment, to the next meeting, or the next event. How can we possibly be on mission if there is not time or space to simply, “be”?</p>]]></description>

This world we live in is broken and messed up. People get sick. People die. Good people, really good people experience pain and suffering. We don’t often see the “why” behind what is going on. All we see is pain, sorrow, tears, brokenness, and heartache. </p>]]></description>

The reality is that could come from just about any pursuit that we are involved in. It could come from the director of a youth sports program. It could come from a business leader.

Who are the people that are trying to fix the brokenness of the world? Who are the people who know these people?</p>,<p>These people are called, “persons of peace.” In every mission setting we need to find a person of peace. </p>]]></description>

My wife, Amy, is commuting to work every day. This means that I get to drive my daughter to dance a few times a week. Those drives are the highlight of my day. It’s amazing to get a chance to hear her heart and just to talk with her. The other she was asking me about the elections in Germany (because why wouldn’t an 8th grader be thinking about such things?). She was explaining how the German Nationalist party grew in power and how they are the descendants, politically, of the Nazis. It really bothered her. She was wondering aloud if we could see the rise of another Nazi Germany. </p>]]></description>
