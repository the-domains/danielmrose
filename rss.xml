If you walk around many cities or college campuses you will find someone screaming that, “The End is Nigh!”</p>,<p>It seems like everyone is looking for “the end of the world.”</p>,<p>Like we will miss it or something.</p>]]></description>

I pretend to like to learn. Learning requires me to change. It demands that I do something different from what I used to do. Learning requires me to change my mind, actions, and possibly even beliefs. So, I pretend to like learning.

Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the “why” and the impact of these statements in our lives.</p>,<p>There are few things more messy and beautiful than the local congregation of Christians. We are a community of people who are being put back together. This means that we haven’t arrived and probably won’t arrive any time soon. Being a people under construction means that there will inevitably be failures and hurts and sin. To be a Christian means that we must be connected to the local congregation, for there is no other place to be a Christian (I’m paraphrasing Eugene Peterson here). </p>]]></description>

We have little to no time to simply be with people. There is no opportunity to listen, pray, or to just look around. Every day we rush to the next place, to the next appointment, to the next meeting, or the next event. How can we possibly be on mission if there is not time or space to simply, “be”?</p>]]></description>

This world we live in is broken and messed up. People get sick. People die. Good people, really good people experience pain and suffering. We don’t often see the “why” behind what is going on. All we see is pain, sorrow, tears, brokenness, and heartache. </p>]]></description>

The reality is that could come from just about any pursuit that we are involved in. It could come from the director of a youth sports program. It could come from a business leader.
