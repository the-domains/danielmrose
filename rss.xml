This world we live in is broken and messed up. People get sick. People die. Good people, really good people experience pain and suffering. We don’t often see the “why” behind what is going on. All we see is pain, sorrow, tears, brokenness, and heartache. </p>]]></description>

The reality is that could come from just about any pursuit that we are involved in. It could come from the director of a youth sports program. It could come from a business leader.

What are they passionate about? What are their hopes? What are their fears? What are the areas in their community that are broken? What are people worrying about? Who are the people that are trying to fix the brokenness of the world? Who are the people who know these people?</p>,<p>These people are called, “persons of peace.” In every mission setting we need to find a person of peace. </p>]]></description>

My wife, Amy, is commuting to work every day. This means that I get to drive my daughter to dance a few times a week. Those drives are the highlight of my day. It’s amazing to get a chance to hear her heart and just to talk with her. The other she was asking me about the elections in Germany (because why wouldn’t an 8th grader be thinking about such things?). She was explaining how the German Nationalist party grew in power and how they are the descendants, politically, of the Nazis. It really bothered her. She was wondering aloud if we could see the rise of another Nazi Germany. </p>]]></description>

Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the “why” and the impact of these statements in our lives.</p>,<p>I remember the day clearly. I was sitting in the office of my pastor and friend, Bob. We were discussing life and following Jesus. We were talking about the Holy Spirit. He was asking me about yielding to the Spirit and trusting him to empower me. I was not totally on board with this idea. As I shared with him that day, the thought scared me, to my core.</p>]]></description>

You know, one of those moments where you feel the flesh waking up. Your face heats up, your pulse quickens, your fists clench, and you know what is about to happen. You know you’re about say something you will later regret. Your mind is screaming, “NO! Stop! Run!” Your flesh is screaming out, “I will destroy. Right here, right now, I will destroy.”</p>]]></description>
