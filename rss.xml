            <description><![CDATA[<h1>So Embarrasing…</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c6104e0-64db-47af-a8a5-501b2e112c28.jpg">,<p>I have two teenagers right now. One of the simple pleasures I get out of being a dad is hearing, "Dad, you're so embarrassing." Yup. That's right! Typically this little phrase flies out when I am not allowing them to do something they want to do. Particularly when this happens in front of their friends. It also happens when I try to be hip and cool (this failed for me even before kids, but now it's just fun to watch them shudder). Even though I embarrass them at times, they still love me fiercely.</p>]]></description>

It was so hard. I cried. He cried. It was awful. Awful. When I say the first time, I mean the first time he could really understand that he was in trouble and that Dad was mad because of his actions. I think he was five or six. He was being ungrateful and so we took away his gaming system. He was able to grasp that this was something different.</p>]]></description>

He is one subversive dude. Jesus doesn't hesitate to say something to make a person feel uncomfortable. He shakes up the status quo. He rattles cages and doesn't even care. No, Jesus was so committed to his mission of directing folks to the Father that he didn't mind upsetting a few apple carts.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Sometimes the simplest way is the right way. It is almost as if we think we need something to be hard and difficult for it to be "right." Why do we think this?

It's a strange thing as you begin to see this happen within yourself. On the other hand, it's really fun when you see it happening in your spouse. What's interesting is that this is true within our relationship with God too. As we grow to love him we will begin to love more of what he loves and hate what he hates.</p>]]></description>

So what do we do? We pick up a rock and throw it into the water. If there was a severe punishment attached to it, we might look around first and then throw a rock in the water. Why do we do that? Is the rule a bad rule? Did the rule make us do this or is there something within us that demands to break the rule?</p>]]></description>

Many days I think, "If I were in charge I could get this place squared away pretty quick." It is easy to judge because our judgement is typically not impacted by context or nuance. I think this is why the Scriptures often remind us who will ultimately judge the nations.</p>]]></description>

Often times we, Christians, try to lower the standard by saying things like, "We're still sinful. We aren't perfect and we won't be perfect." While that's true, the reality is that we as followers of Jesus ought be different. Our lives should look different from people who do not follow Jesus. The kicker is that the world knows this. They know this because we have loudly told them how they ought to live. As a result, they expect us to live up to our standards.</p>,<p>Weird, right?</p>,<p>Or maybe not so much.</p>]]></description>
