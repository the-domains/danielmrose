            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Preach the Truth</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c6365442-4316-4cfc-beb1-44b60b161f3a.jpg">,<p>In our social media world confirmation bias has become the air we breathe. If someone says something we don’t like we can “unfollow” or “unfriend.” It has become easier than ever to only hear, read, or interact with people who confirm our positions. We never need to interact with anyone who disagrees with us. Our positions or perspectives need not ever be challenged and we never need to be made to feel uncomfortable. </p>,<p>The church world is very competitive. Everyone wants to have a bigger and bigger church. Churches compete by having better facilities, cooler bands, and more dynamic programming. More and more they are finding that people will often leave when the preaching makes them feel “uncomfortable.” So, to remain competitive pastors are learning that they need to keep their sermons within a certain range of comfort to the hearers. </p>]]></description>

They live completely in the moment and for the moment.</p>,<p>It drives me crazy!</p>,<p>We’ve all been there. It’s part of growing up. One of the hardest parts of being a parent is trying to teach your children to see more than the “now”. </p>,<p>Something the Christian has to come to grips with is not just that there’s more than the moment, but that there’s more than just this life. We must grapple with the reality of eternity.</p>]]></description>

My wife, Amy, and I both grew up appreciating salesmanship. The other day I had breakfast with my Dad and he told me about his new television. He was not planning on buying a television, he just wanted to go in and buy a rack that was capable of holding his 40” TV and a 65” TV whenever he upgraded.</p>,<p>The salesman went to work.</p>,<p>Dad appreciated the salesmanship (and the price!) so he bought at new 65” TV.</p>]]></description>

I write them and then often wonder if their even read. Potential employers want them to see if this person can follow through on a mundane task or to see if a person will vouch for them.</p>,<p>In the “real” world, there doesn’t seem to be much need for letters of recommendation. Your work speaks for itself. Results matter. Your production in your field is your letter of recommendation.</p>]]></description>

They get frustrated because I don’t really want to discuss things like evolution and existence of God. I’m not all that interested in those questions. I think those questions tend to work themselves out on their own in the mind and heart of a person.&nbsp;</p>,<p>What I’m really interested in talking about is not so much a&nbsp;“what” but a&nbsp;“who.” I am fascinated by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Why? Because the entire faith of Christianity rises and falls on this one man. Quite simply, if he didn’t do what the New Testament writers said he did then Christianity is a complete sham and a waste of time.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

It often feels like they believe the world revolves around them. Don’t get me wrong, they are generous and kind. They care for people and I think they’re good friends. But, they are still teenagers and so at times, they believe the world revolves around them.&nbsp;</p>,<p>I remember when the full reality of my parents divorce hit me. They were divorced when I was nine but it wasn’t until later that it really sunk in. I was probably 12 or 13 and I remember thinking,&nbsp;“Why me?”&nbsp;</p>,<p>That seems to be the question we wrestle with when bad things happen to us.&nbsp;</p>,<p><em><strong>“Why me?”</strong></em></p>]]></description>
