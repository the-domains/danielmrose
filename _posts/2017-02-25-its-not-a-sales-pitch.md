  My Dad and Father-in-law are both car salesmen. My wife, Amy, and I both grew
  up appreciating salesmanship. The other day I had breakfast with my Dad and he
  told me about his new television. He was not planning on buying a television,
  he just wanted to go in and buy a rack that was capable of holding his 40” TV
  and a 65” TV whenever he upgraded.

# It's Not A Sales Pitch
![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/9979ddb769e455aa01e61e0ebd66258e/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3263&cropwidth=3871&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5c957430-d5b9-4c48-bed9-b2a06d1aa93e.jpg&x=0&y=0)

My Dad and Father-in-law are both car salesmen. My wife, Amy, and I both grew up appreciating salesmanship. The other day I had breakfast with my Dad and he told me about his new television. He was not planning on buying a television, he just wanted to go in and buy a rack that was capable of holding his 40" TV and a 65" TV whenever he upgraded.

The salesman went to work.

Dad appreciated the salesmanship (and the price!) so he bought at new 65" TV.

I love watching a master salesman. Amy and I enjoy engaging with salesman at stores and love it when we get to engage with a master at their craft. There is an art to sales and not everyone can do it. What makes one a true master is when they can sell and not lose their integrity.

In the American Christian subculture too many of my brothers and sisters are mistaking the ministry with sales. We have turned the church into a small business and are leveraging marketing techniques as evangelism.

This isn't a uniquely American problem though. Check out what Paul wrote to the Corinthians,

_Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. (2 Corinthians 4:1-2, ESV)_

I wonder what Paul would think of our church marketing strategies? Books written on being "sticky" and figuring out how to "close the back door" are everywhere. We spend money on advertising on social media and through search engines. The Church spends wads of cash on signage and mailings. We create programs that are often bait and switches. "Come participate in (X) for free!" and then somewhere near the middle we "drop the gospel."

Recently, I attended an evening with Ravi Zacharias and Abdu Murray at the University of Michigan. I loved that there was no pretense. There was no under-handedness about what the evening was all about. It was, quite simply, two Christians giving an argument for people to follow Jesus. Everyone in the hall, which was sold out, knew what they were there for, Christian and non-Christian alike. **There was no bait and switch.**

I would love for my colleagues to look at their church ministries and ask themselves this question, "Are we marketers for Jesus or are we missionaries?"

This is a profoundly important question because the gospel is not a sales pitch.
