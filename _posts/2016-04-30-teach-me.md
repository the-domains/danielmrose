# Teach Me

Today I have been thinking about and processing this verse from Psalm 119:66:

> "Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments."

When I pray, I find myself doing a good deal of talking. I share with God all the stuff that is inside me. For the last few weeks I have been going to the gym right after I drop off my kids at school. Recently, I stopped listening to music or the television while I'm there. I simply pray. I can go really fast when I'm having it out with God. It's a great way to burn calories.

This afternoon as I was meditating on this verse, it struck me that I need to grow up. I need to mature. Something in my spiritual experience needs to shift.

Have you ever had that feeling?

For a while now, I have noticed something different in my son when it comes to his athletics. He's very teachable. He pursues coaches and asks questions. He's a sponge. Everything that they say he listens to and tries to incorporate. A few years ago, my son was convinced he knew it all.

I had a kairos moment thinking about this truth. When was the last time I asked God to teach me? It's been a while. I have asked God to **give me**wisdom, insight, and other things. But, I **haven't**asked him to teach me. There's a subtle shift there. Asking God to teach me will necessarily put me in a place where he will change me. Asking God to give me things, even good things, assumes no change.

How about you? Do you want to be taught?
