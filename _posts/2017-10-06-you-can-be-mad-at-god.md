  Life doesn’t always work. This world we live in is broken and messed up.
  People get sick. People die. Good people, really good people experience pain
  and suffering. We don’t often see the “why” behind what is going on. All we
  see is pain, sorrow, tears, brokenness, and heartache.

# You Can Be Mad At God

Life doesn't always work. This world we live in is broken and messed up. People get sick. People die. Good people, really good people experience pain and suffering. We don't often see the "why" behind what is going on. All we see is pain, sorrow, tears, brokenness, and heartache.

I had a friend say to me, "I have to be honest with you. I am really mad at God. Is that OK?" Without hesitation I responded, "Yes!" 

We can be mad at God. 

The Psalms are filled with cries to God in anger and lament. 

It feels like we shouldn't be mad at God. It feels like we should just say, "Thank you." But you know what? There are times when we are mad at God. We are so angry that we can't hardly speak. There are time when our world feels like it is coming apart and it doesn't feel like God is there at all. You can feel that knot in your throat rise up and your eyes become weary with grief. God is distant and he is apparently silent. The grief, anger, and frustration we have for God is palpable. We can taste it on our lips. 

Can we be mad at God? Yes. 

My children love me fiercely. They know how much I love them. I love them sacrificially. Yet, there are times when they get really mad at me. Particularly when there is something that they perceive to be unjust and know that I could fix it if I wanted to. Often what they are missing is the bigger picture that I can see. Sometimes they need to struggle through. Sometimes they don't see the cascade of choices that others made that led to a particular moment. I want them to tell me when they are mad. I want to know their hearts. When that happens I can move toward them in love.

Being mad is part of being in relationship with God as it with anyone else in our lives. The key is, opening ourselves and communicating our anger with him to him and even with a trusted community of friends. 

Psalm 102 has recently been a balm to my soul as I have experienced an anger and frustration with God. Maybe it will help you too. 

_"Hear my prayer, LORD;   
let my cry for help come to you.   
Do not hide your face from me
when I am in distress.
Turn your ear to me;
when I call, answer me quickly.   
For my days vanish like smoke;
my bones burn like glowing embers.   
My heart is blighted and withered like grass;
I forget to eat my food.   
In my distress I groan aloud
and am reduced to skin and bones.   
I am like a desert owl,
like an owl among the ruins.   
I lie awake;   
I have become like a bird alone on a roof.   
All day long my enemies taunt me;
those who rail against me use my name as a curse.   
For I eat ashes as my food
and mingle my drink with tears because of your great wrath,
for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.   
My days are like the evening shadow;
I wither away like grass.   
But you, LORD, sit enthroned forever;
your renown endures through all generations.   
You will arise and have compassion on Zion,
for it is time to show favor to her;
the appointed time has come.   
For her stones are dear to your servants;
her very dust moves them to pity.   
The nations will fear the name of the LORD,
all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.   
For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.   
He will respond to the prayer of the destitute;
he will not despise their plea.   
Let this be written for a future generation,
that a people not yet created may praise the LORD:   
"The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high,
from heaven he viewed the earth,   
to hear the groans of the prisoners
and release those condemned to death."   
So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion
and his praise in Jerusalem when the peoples and the kingdoms
assemble to worship the LORD.   
In the course of my life he broke my strength;
he cut short my days.   
So I said:
"Do not take me away,   
my God, in the midst of my days;
your years go on through all generations.   
In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth,  
and the heavens are the work of your hands.   
They will perish, but you remain;
they will all wear out like a garment.
Like clothing you will change them
and they will be discarded.   
But you remain the same,
and your years will never end.   
The children of your servants will live in your presence;
their descendants will be established before you." _(Psalm 102, NIV)
