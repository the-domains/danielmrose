In faith there is room for doubt. There is room to touch his side and his hands. Faith doesn't demand blind obedience. All it asks for is trust. A trust that the object of your faith can accomplish what is promised. 

For the Christian our faith is in the person of Jesus. He proved himself trustworthy through his resurrection. Doubt, that will come and go and there is space for the doubt. But, not fear. Fear is the absence of faith and trust. Fear communicates that we don't believe that the object of our faith is trustworthy. 

Do you live in faith or in fear? It's one or the other. 

Peter was one who was in fear. Faith changed him. Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples was huddled in fear. Then faith gripped his heart and he walked out of that room and into the world and proclaimed...

_"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know---this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him,_

_"'I saw the Lord always before me,_

_for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;_

_therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;_

_my flesh also will dwell in hope._

_For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,_

_or let your Holy One see corruption._

_You have made known to me the paths of life;_

_you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'_

_"Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. (_Acts 2:22-32, _ESV)_
