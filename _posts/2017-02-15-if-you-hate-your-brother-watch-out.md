# If You Hate Your Brother, Watch Out!

This recent election our country has developed a wider divide than it ever has before. The folks in the middle are more quiet. The folks on either edge are louder and louder.

Within the Church there has been a disturbing trend of people using another's vote as the litmus test for faith. "A person can't possibly be a Christian if they voted for..." Have you said that? If you have then you need to check yourself.

John writes in his first letter this,

Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. (1 John 2:9-11, ESV)

Light and darkness for John are metaphors for faith. He is arguing here that if a person claims to be follower of Jesus and hates his brother is not truly a follower of Jesus. There isn't any gray in John. That's one of the things that I like about him. But, it's also one of the things that scares me a little when I read him. The lines are drawn and you know where you land.

I know I struggle sometimes with other Christians. I want us all to do well and live like Jesus. But there are times when my brothers and sisters are just mean. The Church is comprised of sinful and broken people and so there are times when it will fail.

The question that you and I have to ask ourselves is a simple one: Do I hate other Christians? If we do, then they might not be the ones with the issue, but we are.

You can not hate another Christian and be a follower of Jesus. If you do, you are like one who walks around in the dark stepping on legos and banging your shins on coffee tables.

To live in the light is to love our brothers and sisters. **Loving** them means speaking truth. **Loving** them means extending grace. **Loving** them means giving them time to change. **Loving** them means holding them accountable. **Loving** them means rebuking, reproving, and correcting them.

So, where are you? Do you hate your brothers and sisters?
