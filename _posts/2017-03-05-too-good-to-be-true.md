# Too Good to Be True

It was the summer after my junior year in college and I was working for my dad selling cars. During a sales meeting Marty, the sales manager said, "Remember, when you're talking with a customer about some amazing deal from another dealer that if it's too good to be true, it probably is." Over and over again we find that to be a truism don't we? People rarely under promise and over deliver. The fact is, if it's too good to be true, it probably is. 

Then there's Jesus.

This guy, he over promised and then he delivered. There was no question about it. God made a promise to Adam and Eve and he made good on it. He re-united his people with himself through the cross. 

Paul writes, 

_For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power._

_For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,_

_"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,_

_and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart." _

_Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men._

_For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord." (_1 Corinthians 1:17-31, _ESV)_

Paul, is in effect saying, "Jews and Greeks aren't going to buy this whole cross thing. It's just too good to be true." 

The Jews couldn't buy it because it was a "stumbling block." According to the Old Testament, anyone hung on a tree is cursed. How could this man who died on the cross possibly be the Messiah? The man was made to be a curse, he couldn't possibly offer salvation. How could he? He was forsaken by God. Yet, the gospel is that this man who knew no sin became sin for us. The Jews stumbled over this, it was too good to be true. 

The Greeks who though they were so smart saw the crucified Messiah as "folly." How could a man who died a criminal's death be the redeeming King of the universe? Power came through might. Yet, the gospel says that ultimate power comes through death. This was silly, ridiculous, and folly to the Greek. It was too good to be true. 

The world's wisdom, Paul says, was shown to be foolishness in the wisdom of God. It is foolish to believe that an innocent man would die for a guilty man. Yet, this is what the gospel claims. It seems too good to be true. 

That last verse, "_And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord." _What a remarkable statement of who Jesus is. wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption. This is all wrapped up in the person of Jesus and we experience and know these things through him. 

I suppose the question is what is your understanding of the cross, "_For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." _ Is it folly or is it the power of God?
