# May All Who Seek

Tuesday nights I host a gathering of friends at the [local pub][0]. We pull a couple of tables together and talk about things that matter. We go beyond the chit chat and get into the weighty questions of life. Regardless of our starting topic (things like transgendered bathrooms and the like...) we always end up coming back to a few key issues.

We wrestle through the nature of truth. What is it? Where does it come from? Can it be known? If it can be, where do you find it?

Another key issue we come back to again and again is what is "good"? What is the nature of goodness? Does it exist apart from evil? Who defines it?

There are others, but these two are the big ones.

I love that we have these conversations about things that matter. We go deep. We don't hold back. I think what I love the most is that the people around the table are truth seekers. They are not simply there to win arguments. My friends want to figure out what is real. These conversations have an impact on all of our lives. I leave each week changed.

Psalm 40's closing stanza begins, "But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you." I love this prayer. I have begun praying this for my friends and myself. We seek truth and Jesus declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life..." The fact of the matter is that all of us who are seeking truth are ultimately seeking Jesus. May God bring each of us to the place where we "...rejoice and be glad..." in him!
