# Preach the Truth

In our social media world confirmation bias has become the air we breathe. If someone says something we don't like we can "unfollow" or "unfriend." It has become easier than ever to only hear, read, or interact with people who confirm our positions. We never need to interact with anyone who disagrees with us. Our positions or perspectives need not ever be challenged and we never need to be made to feel uncomfortable. 

The church world is very competitive. Everyone wants to have a bigger and bigger church. Churches compete by having better facilities, cooler bands, and more dynamic programming. More and more they are finding that people will often leave when the preaching makes them feel "uncomfortable." So, to remain competitive pastors are learning that they need to keep their sermons within a certain range of comfort to the hearers.

Sometimes when I read the Bible it feels like it was written with knowledge of the future. Paul, writing to Timothy at the end of his life wrote, 

_"I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. (2 Timothy 4:1-5, ESV)"_

Paul warns Timothy in the first century that the time was going to come when people would "accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions." 

With the development of technology people can podcast preachers who agree with them. They can easily research churches and listen to the sermons of the church and find out if they are comfortable with what is being said. It is easier than ever for people to find pastors who agree with them. 

What is Paul's recommendation to Timothy? Preach the word and do so with complete patience and teaching. So, we must continue preaching what the Scriptures say. We can't wilt from it. The truth can be hard to say. When we hear the truth of the Scriptures it can make us uncomfortable because it demands change. We are called to conform to the Scriptures and not conform the Scriptures to our whims. 

Change is hard and change is uncomfortable. We are broken people and hearing the Scriptures preached will, at times, make us aware of sin. When that happens we either change or we find someone who will tell us our sin is not sin. 

Preachers, preach! Keep on, keeping on! Paul's words are wise to us today too!
