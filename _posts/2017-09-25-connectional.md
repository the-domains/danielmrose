Some [news][0] popped regarding the future of the PCUSA's connectional system:

_A Presbyterian Church (USA) commission has voted 15--5 to allow non-geographic presbyteries. The move, which would allow churches to choose their own groupings for "missional purposes," follows defections over the denomination's vote to ordain noncelibate gays and lesbians. The recommendation needs approval at the General Assembly this June._

The resulting question that was posed by Christianity Today was, "Should denominations be organized geographically." The most prominent published answers that CT showed was "no". Most seemed OK with affinity based connectionalism.  
As a Teaching Elder in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church it makes me sad to think about a time when the geographic presbytery could be replaced by affinity. It is my belief that the geographic based presbytery system is best. I believe this for a few reasons:

1. Presbyteries at there best bring unity of the body, mission, and vision of the particular churches.
2. Teaching Elders, who find their membership in the presbytery, are better served and cared for through geographic proximity.
3. The diversity of churches within a geographic reason is a good thing. It forces particular churches to wrestle with direction and theology. This results in an avoidance of group think. Doors are opened for conversation and debate that eventually should lead to unity and deeper relational connection.
4. Cultural concerns are more unified geographically. While, a church from Ohio may be more similar in vision with a church in California, the concerns of culture are more aligned with a church in Michigan. Proximity is critical.

The move toward affinity presbyteries seems to be a "I'll take my ball and go home" response to difficult issues. It is my hope that the EPC will avoid taking this route at all costs. Although there has been some movement in this direction over the issue of the ordination of women. It saddens me that this would be the case.

The Presbyterian connectional system, in my opinion, is the best there is. I pray it does not destroy itself because of an unwillingness to engage over difficult issues.
