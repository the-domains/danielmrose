# Will You Trust?

I am taking our folks through the whole story of Scripture right now. We are in the book of Judges and this week we are going to be looking at the life of Gideon. The heroes of Judges are just like us. They are regular people with broken lives and struggling with faith. One of the things that I appreciate most about the Bible is that it doesn't try to clean these people up, you see them as they were.

As I have been pondering Gideon's story it strikes me how normal he really is.

He has a conversation with God and his response is, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. (Judges 6:17 ESV)"

This would mark Gideon's entire experience as Judge. He always wanted a sign. Gideon struggled to trust. It was this desire for a sign and lack of trust that eventually caught up to him in the end. After he had conquered the enemies of Israel, Gideon fashioned a golden ephod from the earrings of those he conquered and the Scriptures say, "And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family. (Judges 8:27 ESV)"

Gideon fashioned for himself his own sign and symbol and it snared him. He never learned to trust God and that lack of trust caught up to him.

We are just like Gideon aren't we? So often we cry out to God asking for a sign. We lay out our fleeces like Gideon did (Judges 6:36-40) and hope that God gives us the answer we want. This has the guise the of trust or believing, "I'm believing God for a sign." But, at the end of the day it is more about a lack of trust. We do not want to exercise the faith that God has given as a gift to us (Ephesians 2:8,9).

What would happen if we understood ourselves from God's perspective? What if we could catch a glimpse of how he thinks of us? Could we then trust? From God's perspective Gideon was a "...might man of valor. (Judges 6:12)" Gideon perceived himself as, "...least in my father's house. (Judges 6:15)"

Why didn't he hear what God was saying? Why didn't he grasp the word of grace that the Father was speaking into his life? If he had trusted the one who said he was a "mighty man of valor" how might Gideon's story be different?

What is the word of grace that the Father is speaking to you today? Are you hearing it? Are you embracing your new identity, your God-given identity in Christ?

We grow in trust as we come to deeper understandings who he has made us to be as his children.
