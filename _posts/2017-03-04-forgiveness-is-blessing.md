  I will never forget the day. I was sixteen and had had my driver's license for
  a few weeks. It was one of those fall days in Michigan where the leaves had
  fallen and there was a thick dew. My family lived in a small neighborhood
  shaped like a horseshoe. On my way to school I was changing CDs and not paying
  attention. I looked up to see I was running out of road. I slammed on the
  brakes and turned the car. I had hit the wet leaves and slid into a few
  mailboxes. Looking around, I saw no one, so I backed out and hurried off to
  school.

# Forgiveness is Blessing

I will never forget the day. I was sixteen and had had my driver's license for a few weeks. It was one of those fall days in Michigan where the leaves had fallen and there was a thick dew. My family lived in a small neighborhood shaped like a horseshoe. On my way to school I was changing CDs and not paying attention. I looked up to see I was running out of road. I slammed on the brakes and turned the car. I had hit the wet leaves and slid into a few mailboxes. Looking around, I saw no one, so I backed out and hurried off to school.

After school, I was watching television and the phone rang. My stomach dropped. Somehow, I knew this was about the mailboxes. I heard the "Yes" and "OK" and "We will see you soon, officer." I was dead. Mom looked at me and asked if I had been a part of a "hit and run." I was caught and all I could do was say yes and tell her the story.

We went to the police station where I got a scolding and then I had to apologize to the neighbors. It was horrible.

What was worse was living with the shame of knowing what I had done. In a weird way I was relieved that I had been caught. I could seek forgiveness and move on.

Check out what David wrote about confessing our sin and forgiveness,

_Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven,  
whose sin is covered.  
Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity,  
and in whose spirit there is no deceit._

_For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away  
through my groaning all day long.  
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;  
my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah (Psalm 32:1-4, ESV)_

When we experience forgiveness we experience blessing. This blessing is not material gain. This is a heart level blessing. Elsewhere in the Scriptures it might be referred to as "shalom" or "peace", a wholeness of being.

Notice how David describes being a state where he is hiding his sin from God. Don't we all know that feeling? I know I do. Hiding our sin brings shame, guilt, and we know the heavy hand of God wanting us to shed those things.

David responds to this by saying,

_I acknowledged my sin to you,  
and I did not cover my iniquity;  
I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,"  
and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah (Psalm 32:5, ESV)_

Because he acknowledged his sin, he experienced forgiveness, which then translated to blessing.

Are you holding anything back from God? Are you hiding from him? Are you experiencing the grace and forgiveness that translates into blessing? Take time today to confess. Open your heart and soul to God and know the forgiveness that he offers. His blessing brings shalom, peace, and wholeness of being. Don't miss out on it! Don't walk around with a pit in your stomach and shame on your shoulders.
