# Our Fickle Faith

On Sundays our Missional Communities are looking at the whole story of the Bible. This past Sunday we talked about Moses. This coming Sunday we are looking at the story of the people wandering in the desert. As I started preparing and working through a number of the passages in Exodus and Numbers I was struck by two things: (1) All God asked for was faith and (2) the fickle faith of the people.

Fickle means, "1.likely to change, especially due to caprice, irresolution, or instability; casually changeable; 2\. not constant or loyal in affections." 

This is a perfect description of the people wandering in the desert. It is also the perfect opposite of who God is. 

All the way through the story, God provides, renews his covenant with the people, the people agree, the people whine and complain, God provides, and the cycle repeats itself. The whining and complaining is a direct result of lack of faith. When there is any kind of delay in God's provision the people almost immediately lose faith. They long for being slaves back in Egypt. Their affections are not constant nor loyal and they are "casually changeable."

When I read through these stories I find myself getting real judgy with the people of Israel. I'm all, "You idiots! God was literally present with you in a pillar of cloud and fire. How can you not believe that he would take care of you!? You're pathetic!" Yes, I know, I shouldn't be judgy, they were after all wandering around in the middle eastern desert and my idea of camping is a Holiday Inn Express.

**And that's just it, if I were with them, I would be exactly like them. **

I don't want to admit it but my faith is often fickle too. _When there is any kind of delay in God's provision I almost immediately lose faith._I don't lose it in the sense that I stop trusting Jesus for grace and mercy, but I practically move from a position of trust to a position of self. I try to make up for what I think God is lacking. It's not that Christians are to just sit around and pray all day hoping for God to provide (cue a joke here), but, there is a heart attitude of trust and faith that permeates all we do. Often we set that aside, grit our teeth, and hope we're good enough.

A people of fickle faith, that's part of our family story and it still resonates today. How is your faith? Is it fickle or is it steadfast? I'm praying for God the Spirit to continue working in that area for me.
