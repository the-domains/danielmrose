# Well Yeah, He's Cool, But No

Have you ever entered into something thinking that it was one thing and then discovered it was something completely different? Perhaps I'm a bit too trusting but this seems to happen to me. I want to believe the best in people and trust them. This sometimes gets me into trouble.

This morning I was reading in Mark's gospel the account of Jesus entering the city of Jerusalem. There was cheering and shouting and praising. Everyone was so happy that he had arrived.

They were so happy they threw him a parade...

Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples and said to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.'" And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. And some of those standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?" And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!"

And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. (Mark 11:1-11, ESV)

Who doesn't love a parade, am I right?

What struck me was knowing the rest of the story. In just a short time most of these people would walk away from Jesus. They wouldn't simply ignore him, but they would probably be among the throng calling for his execution.

What changed? Why did the crowds turn so quickly? How do they go from shouting, "Hosanna!" to "Crucify!"?

I think at the end of the day they realized that they weren't going to get what they thought they were going to get. This celebration was the celebration of a conquering king. The masses thought that the savior had come to relieve them of their suffering under the hand of Rome. They thought that Jesus was coming to overthrow the Emperor and return Israel to its place of power and prominence. David's son had returned to restore the throne to Israel!

The problem was that this is not at all what Jesus was up to. He was coming as the savior and he was coming restore the throne and to over throw the empire, but he was doing it in a way that was much more subversive than they could ever have imagined.

Because the masses didn't understand what Jesus was doing, they turned on him. He would not give them the military victory or the blood in the streets that they wanted.

He was not coming to get their paralyzed kingdom moving again, no, he was coming to forgive sin, to set the captives free from themselves, and usher in a new empire, a kingdom of grace, mercy, faith, and love.

It's interesting, **the Jesus way is power through weakness, authority through service, and life through death.** Yet, we as American Christians can identify so clearly with the masses on this day of triumphal entry. We so often look to Jesus as though he is our cosmic hero. We simply leverage his name and use it to gain power. Sufjan Stevens one of my favorite songwriters said that the term "Christian Nation" is heretical because Jesus didn't come to be a modifier.

We may have not shouted "Crucify!" but we have done something more diabolical. We have relegated Jesus to being a modifier for our whims and passions. The American Church has used him to gain power to do the thing that he never intended to do.

I love the way that Eugene Peterson renders Colossians 1:18-20 in _The Message_ because I think it gets to the heart of what we ought to be running after,

He was supreme in the beginning and---leading the resurrection parade---he is supreme in the end. From beginning to end he's there, towering far above everything, everyone. So spacious is he, so roomy, that everything of God finds its proper place in him without crowding. Not only that, but all the broken and dislocated pieces of the universe---people and things, animals and atoms---get properly fixed and fit together in vibrant harmonies, all because of his death, his blood that poured down from the cross.

What if we sought to be agents of properly fixing the "broken and dislocated pieces of the universe" fitting them "together in vibrant harmonies"?
