# Fear and Hate or Faith and Love?

"God is sovereign so we don't need to tell anyone about Jesus."

"I'm not called to be a missionary."

"I'm not gifted in evangelism."

It seems that there are more reasons not to talk to people about Jesus than there are reasons to do it. Everyone is looking for an excuse. Some folks are more theologically astute and make arguments trying to leverage doctrine. It turns out that all of us are invited into God's mission.

So why are we always trying to get out of it?

I think there are two major reasons. The first is that we are afraid. We fear being rejected. We fear being asked a question for which we don't have an answer. There is the fear of conflict. Many of us think that if we talk to someone about Jesus it will turn into a fight. Our fears are probably unending.

The second is more insidious. We simply don't care about people enough to invite them into the kingdom. Even worse, there are people with whom we don't want to spend eternity. _**Those **_people shouldn't get the chance to be reconciled with God. We have so much anger and hatred in our hearts that we refuse to invite _**those**_ people to know Jesus.

Each of us has to deal with our sin sick hearts. We have to ask the question, "Why don't I proclaim the excellencies of Jesus?" Do we fit in the fear category or hate category? Ultimately it is one of the two. We can sugar coat our reasons in some way. The reality is we are either afraid or we lack love, or both.

Which is it?

To be on mission with God means that you have step out in faith courageously. It means that you have to love by faith, even _**those**_ people.

Will you?
