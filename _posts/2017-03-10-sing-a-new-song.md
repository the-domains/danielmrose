Have you noticed when you're around a University of Michigan grad you find that out in the first five minutes of the conversation? If you've ever been around a vegan, the same principle applies. The cross-fitter may be the best example of this! While these are all generalizations and are used as punch lines to jokes, there is some real truth to them. Why? Because these people have experienced significant life change through their experiences and these things have, in a sense, placed a song in their heart.

What song do you sing? What has changed you? What experience or event has significantly transformed you? Where do you find your identity?

How you answer these questions determine the song you sing.

Check out the opening of Psalm 40,

_I waited patiently for the LORD;  
he inclined to me and heard my cry.  
He drew me up from the pit of destruction,  
out of the miry bog,  
and set my feet upon a rock,  
making my steps secure.  
He put a new song in my mouth,  
a song of praise to our God.  
Many will see and fear,  
and put their trust in the LORD. (Psalm 40:1-3, ESV)_

King David is the author of this psalm and he says that God has put a "new song in my mouth." Many of David's psalms are "emo." They are filled with emotion and sadness. Some people might say that he whined a lot. But, in Psalm 40 we find that he has a new song. A song of praise to God is his new song. Where did this song come from? It came from David's recognition of God's salvation. The results? Many others would put their trust in the Lord.

David's identity was fundamentally changed by God's impact on his life.

I want my song to be like David's song. God has radically changed me. He has redeemed me from my own pits, and more than one. God's grace and mercy to me are overwhelming.

How about you? What is your song? Where do you find your identity?

NOTE: I would remiss to not include U2's "40" for your enjoyment...
