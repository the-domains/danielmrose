I often think about _why_ I am a Christian. I grew up going to church. But, so did a lot of my friends who are not Christians. I grew up in 'Merica, but so did my friends who aren't Christians. What happened in my life that led me to following Jesus?

As someone who holds to Reformed theology I know that my coming to faith, ultimately, was God's work. He by his sovereign grace transferred me from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of his beloved son. I believe this and know this. But, what I ponder are the secondary causes that God used to bring about this change.

In John's Gospel he tells the story of John the Baptist. John says,

_The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.' I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel." And John bore witness: "I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God." (John 1:29-34, ESV)_

That last bit caught me up short today, "And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God." It grabbed me because it reminded again of the critical importance of people bearing witness to Jesus in my life.

As I look back at the time when I truly came to faith, God used people in my life to bear witness to Jesus. This word, "to bear witness" is from the law court and it points to someone giving a testimony. People who were following Jesus closely gave testimony. Their lives and their words bore out the truth of who Jesus is.

The Messiah was revealed to Israel by a witness, John the Baptist. The Messiah was revealed to me by many witnesses. Will I be a witness to those in my life? Will you?

If you follow Jesus, you are a witness. Your life and words display, to a watching world, this Jesus you follow. You are called an ambassador. I am called an ambassador (2 Cor 5). We are his representatives.

Take some time during Lent to evaluate your life. What kind of witness are you?
