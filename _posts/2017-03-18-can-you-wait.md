  If you're anything like me you look around at the world and wonder what is
  taking God so long to set things right. Many days I think, "If I were in
  charge I could get this place squared away pretty quick." It is easy to judge
  because our judgement is typically not impacted by context or nuance. I think
  this is why the Scriptures often remind us who will ultimately judge the
  nations.

# Can You Wait?

If you're anything like me you look around at the world and wonder what is taking God so long to set things right. Many days I think, "If I were in charge I could get this place squared away pretty quick." It is easy to judge because our judgement is typically not impacted by context or nuance.

_We give thanks to you, O God;_  
_we give thanks, for your name is near._  
_We recount your wondrous deeds._

_"At the set time that I appoint_  
_I will judge with equity._  
_When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants,_  
_it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah_  
_I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,'_  
_and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn;_  
_do not lift up your horn on high,_  
_or speak with haughty neck.'"_

_For not from the east or from the west_  
_and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,_  
_but it is God who executes judgment,_  
_putting down one and lifting up another._  
_For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup_  
_with foaming wine, well mixed,_  
_and he pours out from it,_  
_and all the wicked of the earth_  
_shall drain it down to the dregs._

_But I will declare it forever;_  
_I will sing praises to the God of Jacob._  
_All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,_  
_but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. (Psalm 75, ESV)_

The Scriptures know that we as people look around and know that the world is not right. Bad people seem to have an advantage over good people. It appears that the bad guys get away with whatever they want.

So we judge. We take it on ourselves to call out bad people and their bad actions. Why? Because it certainly appears that nobody else will take care of it.

Yet, "_At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity." _When? At the time that is set by God himself. He has appointed a time to judge with equity. We can rest in this promise and this truth. When that happens, evil will get its due and good will be lifted up.

The hard part is waiting for that day. The hard part is not getting fed up and trying to take control of something that God has promised to do. I suppose the question that we have to wrestle with is this, "Will we wait?"
