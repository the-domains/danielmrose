# Letters of Recommendation

In my time as a campus missionary and a pastor, I have written many letters of recommendation. I write them and then often wonder if their even read. Potential employers want them to see if this person can follow through on a mundane task or to see if a person will vouch for them.

In the "real" world, there doesn't seem to be much need for letters of recommendation. Your work speaks for itself. Results matter. Your production in your field is your letter of recommendation.

What about us pastors? We don't make anything. People are not widgets we produce. People judge us by butts, budgets, and buildings. Yet, that's not the gospel way. If it were, then we'd have to determine that Jesus was an abject failure. I don't think would be a wise judgment to make.

Is there something else that functions as our letter of recommendation?

The apostle Paul wrote,

_Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. (2 Corinthians 3:1-3, ESV)_

It turns out that our congregation is our letter of recommendation. There is nothing numeric here. It's about the hearts of the people to whom Paul and his team ministered.

Pastor, your letter of recommendation is your congregation. Is it, on the whole, growing in grace? Is it, on the whole, looking more like Jesus? Would it, on the whole, be a welcome bride for the bridegroom Jesus?

Paul anticipates what's through our minds at this moment,

_Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. (2 Corinthians 3:4-6, ESV)_

We are in no way sufficient for these things but we find our sufficiency in God. What a remarkable statement this is. In Christ, we can have confidence that God makes us sufficient to be ministers of the New Covenant. This covenant deals with the heart. Is this not beautiful? Is this not the best news? This is the gospel to us as pastors!

**We are not sufficient, but through Christ we can trust God will make us sufficient.**

This lays me low and fills me up.

Stop worrying about butt, budgets, and buildings. That is not your scorecard. Your scorecard are the hearts of your congregation.

Brothers and sisters, let us grow our people in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control. As we do, we can know that we will have quite the letter of recommendation!
