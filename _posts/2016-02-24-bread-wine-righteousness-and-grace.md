# Bread, Wine, Righteousness, and Grace
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/710c52d7-7a8c-4ef0-acd3-bbbf6f55702d.jpg)

We're all standing in our kitchen around our island. On the island is some homemade bread and some wine. We are stepping into that moment of time where we connect with the divine. After I break the bread and bless the wine I remind my friends to not eat or drink in a manner that's unworthy. That is, we are to make sure that there is nothing between God and us or other people and us.

The question really comes down to this: Are you righteous enough to eat and drink at the Lord's table?

If we are honest with ourselves, truly honest, the answer is always a resounding "No!"

Isaiah said it best, "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!" (Isaiah 6:5 ESV)

In those moments when we see ourselves most clearly we agree wholeheartedly with Isaiah. There is no comparison with the neighbor or "that guy" on the news. There is us and God and in the light of his holiness we don't stack up. The stink of it is, we know we won't ever stack up.

The Apostle Paul quoting from the Psalms writes, "None is righteous, no not one." (Romans 3:10 ESV)

All of us in some way, great or small, fall short of the perfection that is required of us. So what does God do? God, because of the great love he has for us, gives us his righteousness. God the Son, innocent and perfect, chose to take on the punishment that our sin required. As a result God the Father now makes his people righteous through faith. It is an "alien righteousness." That is, this righteousness is not worked up in us. We don't all of a sudden clean ourselves up. No, God the Spirit convicts us of the reality that we need what God the Father offers through God the Son's sacrifice. God the Father then gives us his righteousness.

How do we become righteous? We do so by yielding in faith. We receive this gift of righteousness by grace.

We don't deserve it. Yet our heavenly Father freely gives it.

This is what it is to be "born again." This is the beginning of new life. It's the start.

On Sunday nights in my kitchen, standing around the island, there's not a single person there who is worthy to eat or drink at that table. However, there is a Father who loves those created in his image so much that he makes them worthy.
