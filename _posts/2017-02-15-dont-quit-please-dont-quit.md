# Don't Quit. Please Don't Quit. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f7492c50-6a63-407c-b83b-e6d78613b4dd.jpg)

As a pastor one of the things that I struggle with the most is whether or not I make any difference. Did that sermon change any lives? Did that prayer we did the other day matter? Does anyone actually listen to anything I say? Is there any value, any value at all, in what it is that I'm doing? 

Then Thursday happens.

Thursday is just another day. It is like every other day of the week. You wake up and you do the things you're supposed to do. You keep your appointments. You do your job. 

Every once in a while Thursday isn't _just_ Thursday though. 

Every once in a while Thursday is a reminder that it all counts. 

I was reading this morning in 2 Tim 4 and read this passage again, for maybe the thousandth-tillion time:

I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. (2 Timothy 4:1-5, ESV)

It hit me between the eyes in a way that I'd never seen before. 

Maybe it's because I'm watching Scrubs and am fascinated by Dr. Perry Cox and how he gives JD courage. I don't know. Nevertheless, these words from Paul to Timothy just crashed through my consciousness like a wrecking ball. 

Paul wanted Timothy to know that he needed to do his job. Show up. Be faithful. He says be "ready in season and out of season." Get after it! Put the work in.

**Be prayed up. **

**Be studied up. **

**Be read up. **

At the same time he needed Timothy to know that it was going to be hard. The fact of the matter is that much of what the pastor does is conflict: reprove, rebuke, and exhort. All of those things challenge the status quo in the life of the person. 

"Don't worry Timothy," Paul says, "the time is coming when everyone will ignore you and you'll get to endure suffering! Isn't that great!?" 

What is Timothy to do? He's to show up and persevere with "**complete** patience and teaching." 

Patience, endurance, do the work: **Fulfill you ministry!**

I think that we pastors, or at least this pastor, need a reminder every once in a while that this calling is hard. If it wasn't hard everyone would do it. We patiently teach. We show up and love well. 

It's going to be hard. It's going to cost us something. It costs all of who we are. Paul makes this clear when he goes on to tell Timothy that he is "being poured out like a drink offering."

Every once in a while though Thursday comes. 

Thursday I spent time with a younger man who was processing life. He was wrestling with huge questions of identity and purpose. It was a great time and an amazing conversation. I left that appointment like I do every appointment, praying that maybe it counted for something. 

Later that day my phone notified me that I had been tagged in a Facebook post. There it was. Evidence that it counted. Two sentences that reminded me that as a pastor, when we show up it does count. It does matter. The impact we make is real. 

To my brothers and sisters who are laboring hard, don't quit. Please don't quit! Why? **Because every once in a while, Thursday happens. **
