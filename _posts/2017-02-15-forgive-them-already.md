# Forgive Them Already
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc15e056-f28d-462e-ac83-efa3bfff58c6.jpg)

I am amazed at how easy it is to hold a grudge. Someone hurts you and it just festers there under the surface. You're never able to really let it go. You just hold on to that slight and as a result you lose trust. When trust is lost, dislike, contempt, and hatred comes. 

Why? Because we haven't forgiven them.

Jesus while talking to his disciples says, "And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." (Mark 11:25, ESV) 

This is remarkable isn't it? **When we withhold forgiveness we miss out on the forgiveness of of the Father.**

Some have understood this verse (and the similar admonition from the Lord's prayer in Matthew 6) to refer to salvation. That is, your salvation is always in the balance on whether or not you have forgiven everyone in your life. This is not the case. We know from the Scriptures elsewhere that salvation is a work from God that is given by his grace (Romans 8, Galatians, Ephesians 2 are good places to start). 

What Jesus is referring to here is what happens after you're saved. Sin breaks the relationship with the Father but doesn't end the relationship. When we are holding back from forgiving people we can not experience the forgiveness that the Father is extending to us. 

In my own life when I am holding a grudge, when I am not extending grace to someone, there is a greater sense of guilt and shame in my life. When I am able to finally extend forgiveness, then I experience the same kind of freedom in my relationship with God. 

Who are you withholding forgiveness from? What grudges do you carry? Will you forgive?
