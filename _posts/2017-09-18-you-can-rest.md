I've been in full time ministry for nearly 20 years. I can't count the number of friends who have burned out in ministry. They reach a place of complete exhaustion, desperation, hopelessness, cynicism, or depression that drives them to walk away from their calling. It's usually some combination of these things and more. 

There seems to be one particular trait that is cuts across all these people in their burn out. They were afraid to rest and refused to rest so they could control everything.

Certainly this isn't true of everyone. But it seems to happen more times than not. Why does it happen? What is going on in the lives of Christian leaders that leads them to burn out and to walk away? Is there some root issue that we can see and address? 

I think there is. 

This fear of rest and the resulting refusal to rest comes from a singular lack of trust that God is sovereign. 

I am not referring to issues surrounding the doctrine of salvation. I am referring to the general faith that God is sovereign over his creation. That he is indeed the omnipotent, the omniscient, and the omnipresent God. 

There is a lie that we are taught to believe as American Christians, "God helps those who help themselves." We talk about "praying like it all depends on God and work like it all depends on us." This lie of self-dependence runs deep in our American identity. The "Protestant work ethic" while being good in some ways is detrimental when taken to its extreme end. 

Too many pastors and Christian leaders think if they take a day off the ministry will come apart. They don't believe that other Christians can handle the ministry, so they hold on so tight that they unintentionally, intentionally, make themselves the center of the ministry. 

Our theology actually matters. It has a direct impact on our actions. **How we live displays what we believe. **What are we showing our people if we run ourselves into the ground? If we can never let them lead or trust them with the things of ministry, what are we communicating?

The mission will not be completed by individuals. The mission of God in this world will only be accomplished by the body of Christ. It was never intended to be one man or one woman shows. The mission of God is one that the whole of the body is called into action. The whole Church, not just those with the gifts of preaching and teaching. 

This past summer my leaders wanted my wife and I to take a break from hosting our missional community in our home. At first, I was offended. I thought, "A break? I don't need a break. This is what we love. It is what we are called to!" After the initial shock, I saw the great wisdom of this. So, we let go. Other people hosted and there was great ownership developed. Other people led. Other people were able to use their gifts and began experiencing their calls. It was beautiful. 

We rested. 

We rested fully. 

That first Sunday, I felt anxiety and stress. I worried. But God, in his grace, reminded me that he is sovereign and I could rest in that reality. 

So, I rested. I let go. It was one of the best months of my life. I was fully present to my wife and children. I was fully present in mission. It was refreshing. That simply act of trusting God that other people could host missional community refreshed my soul in ways unimaginable. 

Are you a pastor? A missionary? A leader? Are you living as a functional atheist or do you trust that God is indeed sovereign?
