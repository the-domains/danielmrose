# Let The Elder Be Worthy
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0933cecb-302b-4506-ae11-7d2402847f3a.jpg)

I am at a gathering called Presbytery. This is the regional gathering for the Teaching and Ruling Elders from our region. It's a remarkable time to gather with men and women who have said, "I'm all in. I'm willing to serve the church as an under-shepherd of the Great Shepherd. 

These men and women have experienced an inward and outward call to serve the church. They have studied and prepared to lead through service.

Paul writing to Timothy says, 

Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. (1 Timothy 5:17, ESV)

Elders who "rule well" are to be honored. Paul gives a special nod to those who preach and teach. This group of men and women put themselves out on the front line, exposed for the world to see. 

I love the phrase, "rule well." It points back to the qualifications that Paul stated earlier in the letter, 

The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task. Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church? He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil. (1 Timothy 3:1-7, ESV)

The Elder's public ministry is to be an overflow of his private life. "Above reproach." This person is to live a God honoring life, one of integrity. The Elder's life is to be one that displays the inward reality of their relationship with God. How can you tell someone is living this life?

* Monogamous
* Sober-minded
* Self-controlled
* Respectable
* Hospitable
* Able to teach
* Not a drunk
* Gentle
* Not quarrelsome
* Not a lover of money
* Manages their household
* Not a new believer
* Well thought of by outsiders

Every few months I get to gather with a group of men and women who embody these attributes. It's never convenient. I usually try to find an excuse not to go. But, when I miss it I am the lesser for it. Being with these men and women reminds me of and confirms my calling. Being with them encourages me to press on and to not give up. 

Let the Elder be worthy...
