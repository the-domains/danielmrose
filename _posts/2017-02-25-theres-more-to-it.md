# There's More To It

One of the single hardest things about having teenage children is that they don't see the bigger picture. They live completely in the moment and for the moment.

It drives me crazy!

We've all been there. It's part of growing up. One of the hardest parts of being a parent is trying to teach your children to see more than the "now". 

Something the Christian has to come to grips with is not just that there's more than the moment, but that there's more than just this life. We must grapple with the reality of eternity.

Paul, writing to the church at Corinth says, 

_So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:16-18, ESV)_

Paul and his companions were men and women known to affliction. When they followed Jesus it led them down a path of agony, persecution, imprisonment, and more. Take a look at what they went through, 

_But whatever anyone else dares to boast of---I am speaking as a fool---I also dare to boast of that. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one---I am talking like a madman---with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?_

_If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands. (2 Corinthians 11:22-33, ESV)_

Why would anyone want to live this kind of life? Why would anyone continue to submit themselves to this pain and agony and hardship? 

Why? Because they knew something of eternity. Paul and his companions knew that there was more to their existence than these "light momentary affliction(s)." They were looking forward to an "eternal weight of glory." **Their very identity was shaped by the reality that there was more to existence than this life. **

These people lived in light of eternity. The pain and agony of this life paled in comparison to what they knew was coming. I am convinced that Paul was able to learn to be content in all situations because he was shaped by the coming of eternity. 

Do you live in light of eternity or do you live for the moment? Are you more concerned with this present world and the comforts you can find here than you are with living a life that honors God? Is your identity shaped by this mortal life or by the promise of the immortal life?

Many have said, "He is so heavenly minded he's no earthly good." The reality is that the one who desires to be of great earthly good must be most heavenly minded. Eternity and the hope of an "eternal weight of glory" drives the Christian live a life where **power comes through weakness, authority through service, and life through death. **
