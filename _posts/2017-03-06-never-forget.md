  "Don't forget where you've come from." That's something that a lot of athletes
  say. Have you noticed that? Many of our greatest athletes come from
  unbelievably difficult circumstances. After they hit it big, many give back to
  where they came from. They don't want to forget their story and where they
  came from.

# Never Forget

"Don't forget where you've come from." That's something that a lot of athletes say. Have you noticed that? Many of our greatest athletes come from unbelievably difficult circumstances. After they hit it big, many give back to where they came from. They don't want to forget their story and where they came from.

My story is like many others. I grew up in a single mother home. Mom worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. There were a number of years after my parents divorce where finances were in short supply. My Dad took care of big things for us, so we never missed out on school trips or playing sports. The day to day was different though. We just didn't have a lot. When I was in high school and college I felt ashamed of my story. I just wanted to forget it. I didn't want people to really know about it. But, as I have matured I have discovered that my story is a gift. It is a gift because through it God has shown me what redemption looks like. Through it I am able to meet so many more people where they are at in their lives.

"Never forget." It's something that we need to hear often.

In Deuteronomy 8 Moses is describing to the people the promise land and then he says,

_"Take care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today, lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them, and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied, then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, who led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock, who fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, to do you good in the end. Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.' You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day. And if you forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish. Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God. (Deuteronomy 8:11-20, ESV)_

Moses is saying, quite simply, "Don't forget where you came from!" There would come a time when the promises would be fulfilled and the people might forget how they got there.

Aren't we exactly the same?

We pray for God's blessing and provision. Then, when he provides, we say, "Look at what my hands have done!" We too often fail to realize that part of God's provision is to give us the perseverance and stamina to work hard. Our assumption is that "I did this thing." Yet, God is the giver of all good gifts. We must heed Moses advice to the people of Israel and remember where we came from.

How has God provided for you? Today, take some time and list out his provision and give thanks to your provider and sustainer.
