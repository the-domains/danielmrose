# Thankfulness Our Sacrifice

There are many folks who feel like there are two different Gods in the Bible. They often say, "There's the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament." This feeling comes out because they feel like the God of the Old Testament is angry and the God of the New Testament is loving. As I'm reading through the stories of the Judges of Israel, I totally get that. Yet, over the years I have found that this is simply not the case.

I was reading Psalm 50 today and it talks about God being the judge of all things. You would think that this is where the angry God would show up. God is speaking and asks a rhetorical question in reference to sacrifices, "Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?" He follows this up with a simple command, "Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."

What does the great judge require? A sacrifice of thanksgiving. He wants us to be grateful. His desire is for us to come and say thank you.

Have you ever been around a person who is grateful? They are so much fun to hang out with. They are kind and humble. They tend to laugh easily and they are happy.

God's command doesn't end with a sacrifice of thanksgiving, but he continues with a command for us to ask for help and a promise to deliver. This is not an angry God. This is the same compassionate and loving God we see in the pages of the New Testament. His desire is to deliver people from their distress.

God doesn't desire great sacrifices, but thankfulness and willingness to ask for help.

Are you grateful? Will you ask for help?
