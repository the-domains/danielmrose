  This fall has been so much fun for me. My wife, Amy, is commuting to work
  every day. This means that I get to drive my daughter to dance a few times a
  week. Those drives are the highlight of my day. It’s amazing to get a chance
  to hear her heart and just to talk with her. The other she was asking me about
  the elections in Germany (because why wouldn’t an 8th grader be thinking about
  such things?). She was explaining how the German Nationalist party grew in
  power and how they are the descendants, politically, of the Nazis. It really
  bothered her. She was wondering aloud if we could see the rise of another Nazi
  Germany.

This is a small glimpse of the world that we live in, is it not? We live in a time where it easy to become concerned and worry about a great many things. The 24 hour news cycle is such that we come face to face with every terrible thing that is happening. Worry and fear seem to be all around us. 

Psalm 2 is one of those psalms that I never seem to escape from because we live in a broken world. 

_Why do the nations conspire
and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth rise up
and the rulers band together
against the LORD and against his anointed, saying, "Let us break their chains
and throw off their shackles." _

_The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger
and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, "I have installed my king
on Zion, my holy mountain." _

_I will proclaim the LORD's decree:
He said to me, "You are my son;
today I have become your father. Ask me,
and I will make the nations your inheritance,
the ends of the earth your possession.   
You will break them with a rod of iron;
you will dash them to pieces like pottery." _

_Therefore, you kings, be wise;
be warned, you rulers of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear
and celebrate his rule with trembling. Kiss his son, or he will be angry
and your way will lead to your destruction,
for his wrath can flare up in a moment.
Blessed are all who take refuge in him." _**(Psalm 2:1-12)**

The world we live in is chaotic and messy. It feels very much out of control. There is so much to fear, it seems. Yet, this psalm reminds me one important truth:

**God is on his throne. He is reigning. We have nothing to fear. **

Because of this reality, I can look my precious daughter in the eye and ease her fears. I can, with complete confidence, tell her that she need not worry. I can remind her that God is control. That **he laughs** as the nations rage and plot in vain. She can trust that in the end all will be well.
