# Correcting With Gentleness

Every once in a while I have people who are not happy with how I engage our culture. Usually they don't think that I speak hard enough words to the world within which we live. "You're a pastor, you need to challenge people more. Use your platform...etc..."

I get the sense that I disappoint them because I am not a reactionary and I don't take a hard line with folks. Thankfully, I'm not much of a people-pleaser, yet, it is still frustrating when you know that someone finds you a disappointment.

This morning my reading took me into 2 Timothy 2\. Paul is giving his disciple, Timothy some practical wisdom to carry out his ministry. Here are just a few of the things that he reminds Timothy of:

* Remind the people not to quarrel.
* Present himself as a worker approved by God.
* Handle the Scriptures correctly.
* Avoid irreverent babble.
* Flee youthful passions.
* Pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace.
* Have nothing to do with ignorant controversies.
* Have nothing to do with quarrels.
* Be kind to everyone.
* Be able to teach.
* Patiently endure evil.
* _**Correct your enemies with gentleness.**_

This list is so important and has so much to say to us today. I think this could be a great list to help us engage on social media. Could you imagine how the tone would change on Facebook or Twitter if everyone followed Paul's advice to Timothy?

What struck me this morning was that last admonition, "correct your enemies with gentleness." This is something that we need to do more. I am learning how to do this, very slowly. Correcting people with gentleness is not natural for me.

For much of my adult life my response to people who were wrong about some was...

I have never been known to be gentle. Yet, I have been working hard on learning how to live that way.

What I appreciate about Paul's admonition is that it doesn't shy away from the confrontation. Timothy is to bring correction. He's not to simply ignore it or not address whatever it is that has gone sideways. He's also to recognize that some of these people are indeed enemies. His eyes are to be wide open.

Timothy is to correct these enemies with gentleness. What does that mean? I am learning that to enter in with gentleness is to try and understand the nuances of the other position. It is to do so with a desire to be a peacemaker. It is to enter in with an honest desire for the best of our "enemy."

It's really hard to do. I enjoy winning arguments. I love that feeling of knowing I was right and seeing the face of my "opponent" when they realize they have lost. I am a failed athlete. So being able to win with my mind has always been something that has been very satisfying.

It's also been very destructive. There is a sinful pride in the midst of that. That sinfulness has hurt relationships and some to the point of breaking.

As I'm learning the art of the gentle correction I'm finding that I can speak truth in love. I'm learning how to extend grace and mercy to those who need correction. As a result, relationships are broken less often and I represent Jesus better.

Correcting our enemies with gentleness is hard, but it's worth it.
