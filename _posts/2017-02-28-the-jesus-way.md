# The Jesus Way

An insidious belief has exploded into American Christianity. This belief is that following Jesus will be all roses and puppies. Some call it the "Prosperity Gospel." Its purveyors argue that if you have enough faith then you will have health and wealth. God wants you to be rich and that everything in your life should be going easy and well. 

What an attractive offer! Who wouldn't want that? 

The problem is, that isn't the Jesus way.

The Jesus way is different. It subverts our desires for comfort and ease. His way challenges us to discover the reality that **power comes through weakness, authority through service, and life through death. **Jesus calls us not to wealth and ease but to self-sacrifice. 

Consider this passage from the book of Hebrews as the writer is talking about Jesus, 

_Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone._

_For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. (Hebrews 2:8b-10, ESV)_

Jesus was crowned with glory and honor because of his suffering and death. He was found to be perfect through his suffering. The writer is referring to Jesus' perfect obedience in suffering. Jesus was not purified as though he was in some way sinful. No, his obedience to death was made complete through submitting to the cross. 

What kind of faith is this? Our King, our savior, our God is crowned with glory and honor through suffering! This is upside down and backwards. Typically, we think of glory and honor as the opposite of suffering. But the Jesus way is that suffering, even to the point of death on the cross, gives the crown of glory!

You see, often following God is going to lead us to a place where we will have to experience hardship and suffering. It isn't easy. A call to self-sacrifice necessarily demands a loss of comfort. 

I'm grateful that we have a savior who knows suffering. We have a God who meets us in our pain and brokenness with empathy and not just sympathy. He has compassion because he too suffered.
