# Great Is The Mystery

When I first started following Jesus I wanted to know answers to every question that I had. I **needed** to **know** how everything worked. Two natures, one person? How does that work? One God, three persons? How does that work? Resurrection? Seriously, how does that work? 

There were so many questions and I had to have answers. 

I read everything I could. The Internet was just becoming a "thing." The Church was finally catching up with modernity and there were tons of books on apologetics that I was able to read too. The evidence was out there. 

Yet, my questions were unending. My doubt was real. My faith was real. How could they both exist?

Paul, writing to Timothy, says, 

I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that, if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth. **Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness:**

He was manifested in the flesh,  
vindicated by the Spirit,  
seen by angels,  
proclaimed among the nations,  
believed on in the world,  
taken up in glory. (1 Timothy 3:14-16, ESV, emphasis added)

Great is the mystery of godliness he says. Paul regularly talks about mystery in his letters. He doesn't shy away from it. He doesn't hide from the fact that there is some mystery in our faith. Not everything is easily explained. 

I struggle with the mystery at times. Though, more and more, I am coming to love the mystery of following Jesus. 

_The mystery of faith exists because we follow a God that transcends us and was not created by us. _

If there were easy answers to every question about God, I think I would have abandoned the faith long ago. The mystery of godliness shows me that God is beyond me and my full comprehension. The mystery doesn't mean that I stop looking for answers. But, because God transcends our humanity we will never come to an end of our discovery of who he is. 

This August I will have been married twenty years. I have come to know my wife in ways that I didn't think any person could know another. Yet, I am still mystified by her. I truly know her, but I don't completely know her. I never will. She will continue to be a beautiful mystery to me. 

How much more so is this true of our God? We can truly know him, but we will never completely know him. We can truly understand him, but we will never completely understand him. 

Following Jesus is a beautiful mystery.
