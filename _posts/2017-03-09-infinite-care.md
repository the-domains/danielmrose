# Infinite Care

There are times when we don't think God cares about us. For some of us, we think that we are so good off compared to others that God doesn't need to hear about our troubles. **So, we hold them back from him.** We think, "God has bigger things on his plate to worry about." Our world seems to be coming apart at the seams and our little issues don't appear to be that big. **So, we hold them back from him. **

We also want to please God. This desire to please God is a response to his great sacrifice for us. We are driven to do good and try to honor God with our lives. Yet, we struggle with this question of whether God cares for us.

Psalm 50 sheds a little light on this for me. Check it out,

_"If I were hungry, I would not tell you,  
for the world and its fullness are mine.  
Do I eat the flesh of bulls  
or drink the blood of goats?  
Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,  
and perform your vows to the Most High,  
and call upon me in the day of trouble;  
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me." (Psalm 50:12-15, ESV)_

The Psalmist is telling the people of God what God wants from them. What kind of offering does God want? The psalmist's focus here is on the sacrifices of thanksgiving and vows. These sacrifices are unique. They were peace offerings where the one who worships would eat with their family and those in need. God was the host of the meal (ESV Study Bible note on Psalm 50:7-15). In effect he is saying, "Offer the sacrifices but particularly the ones that bring you together at my table and bring peace."

But that's not all, he says "call upon me in the day of trouble." Do you want to please God? **Bring him your troubles!** What a remarkable thing this is! God wants us to bring our troubles to him. He asks us to do that! He doesn't want us to hold anything back from him. No matter how small you think it is, bring it to God. Why? Because he cares. He loves you. In the midst of all things, he cares about each of us.

**God is infinite. His infinitude allows him to care with an infinite love. **
