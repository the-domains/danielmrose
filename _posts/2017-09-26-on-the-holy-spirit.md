# On The Holy Spirit

\*NOTE: This is the third in a series on the Evangelical Presbyterian Church's,_The Essentials of our Faith_. Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the "why" and the impact of these statements in our lives.

I remember the day clearly. I was sitting in the office of my pastor and friend, Bob. We were discussing life and following Jesus. We were talking about the Holy Spirit. He was asking me about yielding to the Spirit and trusting him to empower me. I was not totally on board with this idea. As I shared with him that day, the thought scared me, to my core.

I had little desire to fully and truly turn over control of my life to "the Holy Spirit." Letting go and "losing control" was not high on my priority list.

The Holy Spirit is a bit of an enigma in Christianity. He is God. He is the third person of the Trinity. Yet, he often feels like that family that doesn't live in the area. In many theology classes he's tacked on. There is little attention given to the Holy Spirit. Even in the creeds he gets a mention but not the kind of treatment of the Father and the Son.

**Why?**

I think perhaps it is because that is, in some sense his role. He is the reflector of glory. If Jesus, though being the very nature of God, didn't see equality with God something to be grasped, how much more so for the Holy Spirit?

Even though he is a mystery, Jesus calls him the "helper" or the "advocate." He is present throughout the Old Testament. King David cries out in the psalm, "Do no take your Holy Spirit from me!" Jesus said it was better for him to leave and send the Holy Spirit than for him to stay.

**Why?**

Jesus lays it all out for us near the end of his life:

* The Spirit will be with us forever (Jn 14:16)
* He lives with us and in us (Jn 14:17)
* He will remind us of everything Jesus said (Jn 14:26)
* He will testify about Jesus (Jn 15:26)
* He will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment (Jn 16:8)
* He will guide us into all truth (Jn 16:13)
* He will tell us what is yet to come (Jn 16:13)
* He will glorify Jesus (Jn 16:14)

The EPC's Essential statement on the Holy Spirit says this, "The Holy Spirit has come to glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to our hearts. He convicts us of sin and draws us to the Savior, indwelling our hearts. He gives new life to us, empowers and imparts gifts to us for service. He instructs and guides us into all truth, and seals us for the day of redemption."

Knowing that the Holy Spirit is in us is uncomfortable and comforting. It is beautiful. Knowing that he is with us means that we can lean on him. We can cling to him and trust that in the storms of life we rest in the reality that "God with us" is not just a Christmas story but is the reality of our lives.

The reality of the Holy Spirit living in me used to scare me, to my core. Now, this truth is a great joy to me. His presence gives me peace. A peace that I can't explain. As I continue to learn to quiet my soul, I am more aware of his presence. I know that sounds really mystical and weird, but it's an ineffable experience. I simply can't explain it, though it is true.

Christian, what about you? Are you yielding to the Spirit in your life?
