# What Does God Want?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1057aa42-2c97-4116-91c3-0e81be39811e.jpg)

One question that I get asked a lot as a pastor is, "What does God want from me?" It can seem like a daunting question. There are so many really good things for followers of Jesus to do in their lives. 

How can anyone possibly figure out what God wants them to do? How are we supposed to live our lives? With the infinite possibilities before us, is there any direction?

God says through the prophet Isaiah,

Thus says the LORD:  
"Heaven is my throne,  
and the earth is my footstool;  
what is the house that you would build for me,  
and what is the place of my rest?  
All these things my hand has made,  
and so all these things came to be,  
declares the LORD.  
**But this is the one to whom I will look:  
he who is humble and contrite in spirit  
and trembles at my word.** (Isaiah 66:1-2, ESV; emphasis added)

What does God want from us? He wants us to be humble, contrite in spirit, and to tremble at his word. 

Humility means that you rightly understand yourself. You know yourself to be imperfect and sinful. You also know yourself to be redeemed and created in the image of God. 

Contrite in spirit means that you are repentant. It means that you are teachable and you are willing to change to be more like Jesus. 

We are to tremble at God's word. When was the last time that you allowed the Scriptures to challenge you and shake you to your core? This is to be our posture before God. 

There are three questions that we must ask ourselves:

1. Do I know who I am?
2. Am I willing to change?
3. Will I hear the Scriptures and let them change me?

I dare you to ask these three questions of yourself for a week and see how different you become.
