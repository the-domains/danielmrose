I really enjoy the movie _Top Gun_. I know it's cheesy. I know it's poorly written and the acting is average at best. It is not by any means a cinematic masterpiece. But, heaven help me, I love it.

One of my favorite moments in the film is this one...

<iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-U1N0VOwXTc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-U1N0VOwXTc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-U1N0VOwXTc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=b7d04c9b404c499eba89ee7072e1c4f7&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style=""></iframe>

It cracks me up. Every. Single. Time. I am sitting here giggling as I write this.

There's a passage in Scripture that always makes me think of this clip. I think if Paul were hanging with the Corinthian church today he might reference this clip as was teaching them. Basically, he says, "Christians, you stink."

Check this out...

_But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? (2 Corinthians 2:14-16, ESV)_

You see, Christians do stink. We are like a burnt offering, we are the "aroma of Christ to God." We bear on us the smell of Jesus. In Acts, Peter and John are brought before the religious leaders and though it was clear that they were unlearned men the Sanhedrin noted that "they had been with Jesus."

There was just something about them.

As a follower of Jesus you smell of life or death. The fact is that the gospel is good news and bad news. For those who embrace it, it is the greatest story ever told. For those who deny it, it is worse than a nightmare.

This isn't because the Christian is being a judgy jerk (at least I hope that's not how you live out your Christian faith). It's just that when we are confronted with Jesus we are either like the "sinners" who hung around him and weep at his feet or we are like the religious and secular powers who mocked, beat, and killed him.

It's an amazing thing, when you seek to live as one who understands that **power comes through weakness, authority through service, and life from death,** you either garner love or hatred. There is no in between.

Do you know why?

Because Christian, you stink.
