Tuesday nights are my favorite night of the week. Hands down, it's not even close. On Tuesday nights I gather with a group of people who were once strangers but have become friends. On Tuesday nights I hear some of craziest, most genuine, honest, authentic, and insane perspectives on the world.

I love Tuesdays because they are the night that I host [Doubt On Tap][0]. It's an evening at a pub where a group of people get together and talk about things that matter. We discuss our perspectives on the world and nobody is afraid to share because they know that they will be heard. We rarely agree on anything, but each of us are heard. 

There is a significant need in our world for people to spend time with others that disagree with them. Because of the advance of technology we now have the ability to silence just about anyone who disagrees with us. We don't need to engage, interact, or entertain ideas that make us feel uncomfortable. 

To the contrary, many institutions are now going out of their way to make sure that everyone feels comfortable. People don't argue for ideas any longer, they argue for comfort. When someone disagrees with you they don't push back on your idea. They don't tend to produce counter ideas or even opinions. They simply say, "I'm not comfortable with that." 

Now, more than ever we need to engage with people who are different from us. We need to interact, face to face, with people who are not likely to agree with us on anything. As I write this, I feel almost desperate. We have so isolated ourselves from one another that we are afraid to truly interact and engage with people we are not certain will hold a "comfortable" perspective. There is such a desire for a sense of "peace" that we are unwilling to have the necessary conversations to bring about true "peace." 

Consider the issue of racism, as one example. My black friends want to talk about it. There is almost a sense of desperation as they try to raise the issues. My white friends don't want to talk about it. They think if we would just _stop_ talking about it, it would go away. They are uncomfortable discussing the issue and so they hide from it. How does this bring peace? It doesn't. We need to talk about these issues and we need to keep talking until people are truly heard and understood. 

So, I invite you to come to [Doubt on Tap][0] on Tuesday nights at 8 pm. Click on the link for all the information. 

I leave you with these wise words from Former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice,
