\*NOTE: This is the fourth in a series on the Evangelical Presbyterian Church's, _The Essentials of our Faith_. Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the "why" and the impact of these statements in our lives.

"Sometimes we forget the center. Sometimes we forget what it's all about. Sometimes we forget what we are supposed to be focused on."

Where do you think statement comes from? The reality is that could come from just about any pursuit that we are involved in. It could come from the director of a youth sports program. It could come from a business leader. It could come from a parent. As a pastor, I find myself thinking and saying it often about the Church.

Too often we get caught up in lots of good things. These good things take our focus and attention off the center, the very thing that makes us unique.

What is the center? I think the following statement points us in that direction:

_"Being estranged from God and condemned by our sinfulness, our salvation is wholly dependent upon the work of God's free grace. God credits His righteousness to those who put their faith in Christ alone for their salvation, and thereby justifies them in His sight. Only such as are born of the Holy Spirit and receive Jesus Christ become children of God and heirs of eternal life."_

Paul in his second letter to the Corinthians calls us "ambassadors." An ambassador has a message that she has been entrusted with. That message, for the Christian, is the gospel. The gospel can in many ways be more than the statement above, but I am convinced it cannot be less.

There is a reality that we as people need to understand that there is a brokenness that is inherent to our natural state. Our relationship with God is broken and we are estranged from him. The life, death, and resurrection makes a way for us to be reconciled with God. His grace and mercy are extended and we are saved. We become heirs of eternal life.

We cannot add anything to our salvation. We don't bring anything to it but our brokenness. God saves us. God keeps us. God justifies us. God gives us his righteousness. The beauty of this overwhelms me. I hope that the beauty of this reality overwhelms you.

Our center, our message, is the gospel. It is the story of the God who takes broken people and puts them back together. He takes a broken world and makes it new.
