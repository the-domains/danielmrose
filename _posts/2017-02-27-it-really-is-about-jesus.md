# It Really Is About Jesus

There is a constant refrain in our culture today, one that I have sometimes embraced, "Jesus, save me from your followers!" The Church has a bad rap because it is filled with broken people. We are all in process trying to be more like Jesus but we all fail, often. It gets really ugly when we "Jesus wash" our sinful behaviors. 

The church functions in this world as Jesus representatives. It is completely fair for the world to, in some way, judge Jesus by the actions of the church. While it is fair, it is sad. It is sad because we fall so far short of who he is.

Hebrews opens this way, 

_Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. (Hebrews 1:1-4, ESV)_

This passage leaves me speechless in light of the beauty of the person of Jesus. He is the ultimate expression of the Godhead. He is the radiance of the glory of God. He is the exact imprint of God. He upholds the whole creation by his word. He made purification for sins. This Jesus, our Jesus, sits at the right hand of the "Majesty!"

I desperately want people to know Jesus. If people could get to know Jesus, then they will know God and they will know themselves too. In Jesus we see God, the invisible and unfathomable God is found in Jesus of Nazareth. 

What a remarkable thing it is that the ultimate expression of God is found in a poor carpenter born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth! There was nothing majestic about the life of Jesus. He walked the dusty streets of Judea. He was followed by a group people who didn't "get him." His disciples were scruffy men and some women of questionable character. 

This is God. 

This is our God.

Let's show the world Jesus. 

When the world sees Jesus they see the radiance of the glory of God! They see one who has ushered in the reality of **power through weakness, authority through service, and life from death!**
