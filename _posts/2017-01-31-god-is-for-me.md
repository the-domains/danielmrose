We want to have people in our lives that we can know without question are for us. I love spending time with those people. They encourage me and make me want to be the best version I can. I am able to hear from them rebuke and challenge. Why? Because I know they are for me.

As we walk through this life and these days as followers of Jesus we can know one thing for certain, "that God is for \[us\]."

What are marvelously gracious reality.

_Psalm 56_

_To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath._

_Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me;  
all day long an attacker oppresses me;  
my enemies trample on me all day long,  
for many attack me proudly.  
When I am afraid,  
I put my trust in you.  
In God, whose word I praise,  
in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.  
What can flesh do to me?  
  
All day long they injure my cause;  
all their thoughts are against me for evil.  
They stir up strife, they lurk;  
they watch my steps,  
as they have waited for my life.  
For their crime will they escape?  
In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!  
  
You have kept count of my tossings;  
put my tears in your bottle.  
Are they not in your book?  
Then my enemies will turn back  
in the day when I call.  
This I know, that God is for me.  
In God, whose word I praise,  
in the LORD, whose word I praise,  
in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.  
What can man do to me?  
  
I must perform my vows to you, O God;  
I will render thank offerings to you.  
For you have delivered my soul from death,  
yes, my feet from falling,  
that I may walk before God  
in the light of life. (ESV)_
