I'm With You

You know that time when you watch a television show and it shakes you up a bit? Sometimes works of fiction do that to me (A Brave New World rocked my world). Sometimes it's reading history. Other times it is talking with a new friend. In this particular moment, it was a television show. 

We were watching Madam Secretary and one of the plot lines revolved around the middle daughter, Ali, and the youngest child, Jason, going to a school dance. Ali was wearing a slightly provocative dress and attended with a senator's son. Jason overheard her date in the bathroom talking about how he was going to "get some." Jason didn't do anything. 

That evening Jason and Ali were talking and Jason learned that Ali had to fight her date off so she didn't get raped. She challenged for not doing something when he heard the boys talking. Ali said something like, "There will always be boys like that until boys like you stand up to them and stop them."

It got me thinking about all the women in my life. I had strong independent grandmothers. My Mom raised three boys on her own. My wife is amazing beyond my ability to describe. My daughter is a force in this world. Beyond them, there are so many others too. 

I read through the Twitter [\#ThingsOnlyChristianWomenHear][0] and my heart broke. Then I got angry. Then I realized how I'm complicit to everything that those women hear. I am complicit because I haven't spoken up. It's similar how I am complicit when I don't speak up for my black friends. 

I grew up in my faith in the context of a very conservative Christian organization. I continued growing in a denomination that was very "complementarian." 

The first time I was challenged to begin thinking about women and their role in the faith was during a sermon on 1 Corinthians where our pastor talked about how every Christian is to have a ministry of the Word and prayer. But, only men could do that in the context of leading a congregation. That didn't sit well. 

I went on a journey. 

It was a journey that challenged many of my core assumptions about the Bible, Christianity, and what it meant to be male and female. I had to wrestle with my hermeneutics and exegesis of many passages. The Bible came to life as I wrestled with the passages and continued to work through my understanding. The fact of the matter is, that I'm still wrestling. I don't have all the answers to everything. Some of my questions are left unanswered because the ones that I have come up with or have found seem inadequate.
