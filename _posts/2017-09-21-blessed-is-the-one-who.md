We live in a time when people are always talking about how "blessed" they are. Typically that is in reference to their financial well-being. Yet, when we spend time reading the Scriptures, this image of "blessed" is not really what we see emerge.

I was reading Psalm 1 today. Check it out...

_Blessed is the one who   
does not walk in step with the wicked  
or stand in the way that sinners take  
or sit in the company of mockers,  
but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,  
and who meditates on his law day and night.  
That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,  
which yields its fruit in season  
and whose leaf does not wither---whatever they do prospers.  
Not so the wicked!  
They are like chaff that the wind blows away.  
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,  
nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.  
For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,  
but the way of the wicked leads to destruction._

I have heard this psalm taught more times than I can count. The focus is almost always on "the wicked" and very rarely on the "blessed." The first line of this poem in many sermons feels like an add-on. Yet, I have not been able to escape it. 

In a culture where "blessed" usually refers to material gain, this ancient poem subverts that notion. To be "blessed" is not about what we get or have. To be blessed is to be one who finds their delight "in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night." 

The psalmist is pulling us away from our materialism and consumerism. Blessing is being able to take joy in God's word and meditate on it. When we experiencing blessing in this way, we find a blessing that is not fleeting. It is not dependent on our circumstances. The blessing that comes from spending time in the Scriptures is one that stays with us because the Scriptures get into us. 

We need to be reminded over and over again that to be blessed is something different than simply getting what we want. When we reflect on God's provision, we express gratitude. "Blessed" is deeper than that. It is rooted in relationship with God. 

If we can understand blessing as rooted in relationship with God, it helps us understand more fully what it means to be a blessing to others. It is about entering into relationship. 

To be "blessed" is to be one who delights in God's word.
