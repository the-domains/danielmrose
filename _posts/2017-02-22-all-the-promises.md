# All The Promises
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0c3410d-1096-434e-98a3-6e8a0b632681.jpg)

When I spend time talking with friends, who are not Christians, about religion they often get frustrated with me. They get frustrated because I don't really want to discuss things like evolution and existence of God. I'm not all that interested in those questions. I think those questions tend to work themselves out on their own in the mind and heart of a person. 

What I'm really interested in talking about is not so much a "what" but a "who." I am fascinated by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Why? Because the entire faith of Christianity rises and falls on this one man. Quite simply, if he didn't do what the New Testament writers said he did then Christianity is a complete sham and a waste of time.

But, that's just apologetics. What really captures my heart about Jesus comes to life in something that the apostle Paul said to the Corinthians in his second letter to them, 
> 
> For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. (2 Corinthians 1:20, ESV)

When I ponder who Jesus is this reality that "all the promises of God find their Yes in him" boggles my mind. My heart explodes in wonder at this statement. 

Just think about this one psalm and that the promises made within it find their "Yes" in Jesus, 

_I lift up my eyes to the hills.  
From where does my help come?   
My help comes from the LORD,  
who made heaven and earth._

_He will not let your foot be moved;  
he who keeps you will not slumber.  
Behold, he who keeps Israel  
will neither slumber nor sleep._

_The LORD is your keeper;  
the LORD is your shade on your right hand.  
The sun shall not strike you by day,  
nor the moon by night._

_The LORD will keep you from all evil;  
he will keep your life._

_The LORD will keep  
your going out and your coming in  
from this time forth and forevermore.   
(Psalm 121, ESV)_

There is no other hope that we have apart from Jesus. The promises of God are made complete in him. We can know that God's promises will be made good because Jesus rose from the dead. It is in him that everything is wrapped up and pulled together. It is through him that we can know God's love, grace, mercy, righteousness, and beauty. It is through him that we experience the fullness of God's promises. 

While the follower of Jesus lives by faith. We do so with a knowledge that all has been fulfilled in and through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. 

When it comes to talking about my faith I want to talk about Jesus. I want to introduce people to Jesus. I want people to know Jesus. I want people to fall in love with Jesus. 

Why?  
Because, "all the promises of God find their Yes in him!"
