# What If?

Do you ever play the what if game? I do all the time. I think that's why I am fascinated by _Man In The High Castle_, _The Flash, _and _Back to the Future_. I often wonder, "What if I had been alive in the 1950s, would I have been against Civil Rights?" 

"What if I had been alive in the 1930s would I have been for isolationism?"

"What if I had been alive in the 1850s would I have been pro-slavery?"

"What if..."

There's a parable that Jesus tells in Mark 12 that has me wondering, "What if..."

Check it out, 

And he began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country. When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed. He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. Have you not read this Scripture:

"'The stone that the builders rejected  
has become the cornerstone;  
this was the Lord's doing,  
and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"  
And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they left him and went away. (Mark 12:1-12, ESV)

The parable is summarizing the story of the people of God. The planter is God the Father, the servants are the prophets of what we call the Old Testament, and the beloved son is God the Son, Jesus. 

I have to wonder, if I were around in Jesus time would I be one of the tenants? Would I not only ignore but also beat and kill God's servants and his son? How would I respond to the call of God in the world? 

We live in a time when the gospel is supremely subversive. It undercuts almost every aspect of American culture. It calls for **power through weakness, authority through service, and life through death. **There is nothing about our popular culture that the gospel doesn't subvert. 

Our comfort, our safety, our ease of life, our entertainment, our lust for violence, our lust, our reckless desire for gratification; these are all subverted by the gospel. 

Who are the servants that are speaking for the Father? By and large they are the ones speaking truth to power. They are the pastors who are speaking for the least of these. They are the ones who are not willing to support the empire in its oppressive regimes. 

When we hear the subversive gospel will we embrace it or will we kill the messenger?
