\*NOTE: This is the fifth in a series on the Evangelical Presbyterian Church's, _The Essentials of our Faith_. Scriptural proofs can be found elsewhere. These posts will focus on the "why" and the impact of these statements in our lives.

There are few things more messy and beautiful than the local congregation of Christians. We are a community of people who are being put back together. This means that we haven't arrived and probably won't arrive any time soon. Being a people under construction means that there will inevitably be failures and hurts and sin. To be a Christian means that we must be connected to the local congregation, for there is no other place to be a Christian (I'm paraphrasing Eugene Peterson here).

Check out the "essential" statement of "the Church" by the EPC, 

_The true Church is composed of all persons who through saving faith in Jesus
Christ and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit are united together in the
body of Christ. The Church finds her visible yet imperfect expression in local
congregations where the Word of God is preached in its purity and the
sacraments are administered in their integrity, where scriptural discipline is
practiced, and where loving fellowship is maintained. For her perfecting she
awaits the return of her Lord._

What do we gain from this statement? The Church is made up of people. People who are being saved. This means people who don't have it all together. It means that through the work of the Holy Spirit, they are becoming more like Jesus. This common faith is what makes us the Church. We are saved into a community and not left to fend for ourselves. We are part of a family. 

We also see that our expression of being the Church is imperfect. There are no perfect local congregations. All of them are flawed in some way. As a friend once told me, "All communities have manure. You just have to figure out which manure smells the best to you." 

In spite of the imperfections, there are some things we look for in a local congregation. The Scriptures need to be preached in their purity. That is, they are not being manipulated or being handled falsely. The sacraments are administered in their integrity. This means that they are administered with sincerity and authenticity. It means that they are held in high regard. On a side note, you can hold differing views on the sacraments and still practice them with integrity. My Baptist brothers and sisters hold to a different perspective than I do, but I don't hold their practice of baptism as having less integrity. 

In a healthy local congregation we will see spiritual discipline practiced. Discipline is a bad word now because many churches have practiced spiritual abuse and not discipline. The root of discipline is disciple, that is to teach. When we talk about proper and good spiritual discipline we are talking about reconciling someone who is struggling with sin. We are not looking to dump shame, guilt, and legalism. It is done in the context of love, grace, and mercy. 

The local congregation practices loving fellowship. This goes beyond a Sunday worship gathering. Loving fellowship includes relational connection in all of life. The local congregation is to be part of one another's lives. The initial touchstone each week may be the worship gathering, but that is not the end of the connection. 

Finally, the local congregation longs for the return of Jesus. We long for his returning because it is then that all will be made perfect. The world will be made new. All the pain, the suffering, all that sadness, will be gone. There will be no more tears. We will all be finally and perfectly put back together. 

To be a part of the Church is beautiful. To be a part of the local congregation is really hard. But it is worth it. Within it we meet Jesus.
