One of my favorite stories in the whole of the Scripture is the story of Saul's conversion. It takes place in Acts 9\. He's running around trying to wipe the Church off the face of the Earth and God gets his attention. 

That's not the part of the story that grabs me.

I love this other guy, Ananias of Damascus. He is called, "disciple." Some day I hope to be known simply as a "disciple." God shows up to Ananias in a dream. He tells him that he needs to get up and go meet this guy Saul and restore his sight to him (that's how God got Saul's attention). 

Ananias' response? "I have heard many reports about this and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name." 

Let me clarify for you, "Umm...Jesus, yeah, I'm not hip to being arrested and sent to Jerusalem where they might do me like they did you bro." 

The Lord responds, "Go!" 

At this moment Ananias has a decision to make. Will he do what the Lord wants him to do? Will he say, heck no? What will he do? 

Ananias goes. He shows up and he does this thing that God asks him to do. 

The rest, as they say, is history. 

Saul goes on to write two thirds of the New Testament. He plants congregations all over the known world. He leaves a mark on the world that is being felt still today. 

You know who we don't talk about? Ananias. Just some no name guy who best known for being a disciple. This guy risked his life to obey God's call and show up. God used him. This humble man showed up and changed the world. After this we never see him again in Acts. He is lost to history. 

One man showed up and the world changed. 

We as followers of Jesus don't have a very high standard to reach when it comes to mission. Simply showing up is the first step and sometimes it's the only step. Some of us will have ministries that will last for decades preaching and teaching the people of God. Some of us will show up, in obedience, in faith, for one person, change the world, and then go home. 

Where is God calling you to show up? Your workplace? Your neighborhood? Your team? Your school? 

Will you hear his call? Will you go?
