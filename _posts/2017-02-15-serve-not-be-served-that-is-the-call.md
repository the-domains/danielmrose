# Serve. Not Be Served. That Is The Call.

This week there was an incident at a basketball game where a former player felt that he was disrespected. He lashed out with violence. Every day it seems like people are angry, hurt, upset, because they feel disrespected by someone or something that someone said. 

In my tribe, Evangelical Christians, there is a constant underlying current of complaint about being disrespected. Many people voted for a candidate for President of the United States because they believed he would "give them a seat at the table." There is a desire for power and respect that has trumped our desire for holiness, service, and love.

There's a great story of Jesus, James, John, and the "other ten" in the Gospel of Mark. Check it out:

And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you." 

And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" 

And they said to him, "Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory." 

Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?" 

And they said to him, "We are able." 

And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared." 

And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. And Jesus called them to him and said to them, "You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." 

(Mark 10:35-45, ESV)

James and John wanted a seat at the table. They wanted the power positions. They had aspirations and dreams of having leadership, authority, and influence. To be Jesus' right and left hand men would have been amazing. 

What was the cup and baptism? The crucifixion. To give his life for many. This was the cost. 

This is the ultimate conundrum of the Christian life... 

**Power comes through weakness. **

**Life comes from death. **

**Authority comes through service. **

When we talk about "being disrespected" or our "rights" we are missing the heart of following Jesus. Paul lays this out succinctly in his letter to the Philippians:

So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. _**Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.**_And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:1-11, ESV, emphasis mine)

We have largely lost this attitude and mindset in the American Christian experience. There is an expectation and desire for power and influence that we somehow think we deserve. 

**We don't.**

The follower of Jesus is called to live in the conundrum. We are called to live lives that demonstrate, **power through weakness, life from death, and authority through service**. 

I don't like to live that way. It's hard. I confessed to some friends about an interaction with someone where I felt disrespected. It made me so angry. I really wanted to lash out and "own" the person with all my wonderful knowledge. I chose not to. I felt anxious and angry for a few hours but then realized, in so doing, it would allow me further conversations and hopefully influence. 

To live a life of **power through weakness, life from death, and authority through service** means that we will set aside "selfish ambition or conceit, and in humility count others more significant than" ourselves.
