I often think about what it must have been like to live in the Old Testament times. For some reason I am fascinated by the thought. I am quite certain that I would never want to actually have lived then, but to ponder their lifestyle is something that captures my imagination.

This is particularly true when I read something like Psalm 84, 

_How lovely is your dwelling place,_

_O LORD of hosts!_

_My soul longs, yes, faints_

_for the courts of the LORD;_

_my heart and flesh sing for joy_

_to the living God. _

_Even the sparrow finds a home,_

_and the swallow a nest for herself,_

_where she may lay her young,_

_at your altars, O LORD of hosts,_

_my King and my God._

_Blessed are those who dwell in your house,_

_ever singing your praise! Selah_

_Blessed are those whose strength is in you,_

_in whose heart are the highways to Zion._

_As they go through the Valley of Baca_

_they make it a place of springs;_

_the early rain also covers it with pools._

_They go from strength to strength;_

_each one appears before God in Zion. _

_O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer;_

_give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah_

_Behold our shield, O God;_

_look on the face of your anointed!_

_For a day in your courts is better_

_than a thousand elsewhere._

_I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God_

_than dwell in the tents of wickedness._

_For the LORD God is a sun and shield;_

_the LORD bestows favor and honor._

_No good thing does he withhold_

_from those who walk uprightly._

_O LORD of hosts,_

_blessed is the one who trusts in you! (Psalm 84, ESV)_

This is a psalm of pilgrimage. The people of God would set out on pilgrimage to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem. There was no place else that they could offer sacrifices and reconcile themselves with their God. 

Could you imagine what it must have been like? As they approached Jerusalem, from the valley, they would see the Temple. In their hearts they knew that they would soon be able to worship God in his presence. Perhaps, as they traveled they sang this psalm and it filled them with joy. Coming to the Temple Mount was a moment of joy and fear and hope and reconciliation. 

Yet, what sadness that pilgrimage was required. How heartbreaking it must have been to walk away from that place and know that kind of separation from their God. 

Through the coming of the Messiah we no longer have to experience that kind of separation. Jesus reconciled all things to himself through his death and resurrection. We can now enter into the presence of God with boldness and confidence because of what Jesus has done. We worship not on any particular mountain but in spirit and truth (John4). 

Do you ever just think on that reality? The blessed ones of whom the psalmist speaks are us. We dwell in God's presence forever. It is our reality now. Not because we are worthy but because of what Jesus has done for us! 

Rejoice!
