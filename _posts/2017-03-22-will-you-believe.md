  There are times when I am surprised by how complicated we make things.
  Sometimes the simplest way is the right way. It is almost as if we think we
  need something to be hard and difficult for it to be "right." Why do we think
  this? What is it about ourselves as people that demands we pursue the
  complicated and hard and equate it as "right"?

There are times when I am surprised by how complicated we make things. Sometimes the simplest way is the right way. It is almost as if we think we need something to be hard and difficult for it to be "right." Why do we think this? What is it about ourselves as people that demands we pursue the complicated and hard and equate it as "right"?

It ties back to the fall of man. The curse of the man is that, "By the sweat of your face you shall bread (Gen 3:19a)." So, we are constantly pursuing the work that is hard. This hardness and difficulty is an aspect of our curse.

Should it surprise us when Jesus shows us the easy way?

In John 6:22-40 we see Jesus do just that. The people ask him, "What must we do to be doing the works of God?" What a fascinating question. The Scriptures have told them such a thing in Micah 6:8, "...what does the Lord require of you but to do justice and love kindness and to walk humbly with your God." Jesus could have answered them with this. He could have said, "Have you not read the Scriptures? The prophet said..."

He doesn't. He responds differently. He says, "This is the work of God, that you believe in whom he has sent."

God's work is to believe in Jesus.

What does Jesus say that God wants us to "do" above all else? Believe.

How can it be this simple? Doesn't God demand more of us? What about Micah 6:8? What about the commandments? What about the law?

Jesus did these things and he did them perfectly. He has fulfilled the law. He has lived out Micah 6:8\.

The Scriptures tell us that God made him (Jesus) who knew no sin to become sin so that we might become the righteousness of God. Think about this for a moment. When we believe in him whom God sent, we become something different. We become the very righteousness of God. This means that as we believe, we will live out Micah 6:8, we will live out the commandments, we will fulfill the law. It will take time for this change to happen, we call this "sanctification." But, over time as we hold on to our belief and persevere in faith, it will happen. We will become the righteousness of God experientially, not just positionally.

What are we supposed to do? Something simple. We are to believe. Do you?
