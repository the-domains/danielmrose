When I saw the headlines my heart broke for this man and his family.</p><p>This Christmas I received his autobiography and was deeply moved by Hamilton’s story. What struck me was how real he was. It appeared that he held nothing back and gave the reader full access to his life.</p><p>In the midst of his story he shared the centrality of knowing Christ as the centerpiece to his recovery. For Hamilton, being a Christian made all the difference.</p><p>As I have thought about what’s happened in recent days it has become clear that once again, for Hamilton, being a Christian will make all the difference.</p><p><em><strong>Josh Hamilton didn’t fall from grace, he’s falling into grace.</strong></em></p><p>Paul writes this,</p><blockquote><p>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></blockquote><p>The difference for Hamilton this time around is that even though he has sinned, this time, he is now free from it. What does that mean? Hamilton can know that he has forgiveness, mercy, and grace. Jesus has dealt with his sin. Hamilton is no longer a slave to addictions.</p><p><strong><em>Does he need to fight them? Yes.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Does he need to wage war against them? Yes.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Does he need to do everything he can to protect himself against them? Yes.</em></strong></p><p>But, as Paul says later in his letter to the church at Rome,</p><blockquote><p>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p></blockquote><p>Hamilton’s story is a stark reminder that sin is ever crouching at our door and it is ready to pounce. It is always there for us to give in to its enticements.<strong><em>For all of us.</em></strong>But the beauty of the gospel is that we can experience grace because of what Jesus did.</p><p>No, Josh Hamilton didn’t fall from grace. He fell into it. He is neck deep in the grace that God the Father has lavished on us through God the Son.</p><p>I have never met Josh Hamilton, I probably never will, yet I find myself praying for him. Here’s what I’ve been praying, maybe you’ll join me (if not for Josh Hamilton, maybe someone else who is a follower of Jesus and struggling too):</p><p><em>And so, from the day I heard, I have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. </em></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">The Journal</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
